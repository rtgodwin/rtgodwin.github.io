# Quests

Looking for money? Many factions in Waterdeep.

- Emerald Enclave: an interest in protecting nature or the natural order to join the Emerald Enclave. Druids and rangers are especially welcome.
- Harpers: Any smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of Waterdeep. Bards and wizards are especially welcome.
- Lord's Alliance: To become a member of the Lords’ Alliance faction in Waterdeep, a character must be a Waterdavian citizen. Those with criminal records can also join, provided they demonstrate their allegiance to the city.
- Xanathar Guild: Anyone can join the Xanathar Guild, which, despite its name, doesn’t have official guild status in Waterdeep. Before membership is granted, however, an applicant must pass a test that always involves the perpetration of a serious crime. Possibilities include murdering a guild member who has failed Xanathar in some fashion, kidnapping a Waterdavian citizen, collecting a ransom, robbing a hire-coach, or looting a warehouse.
- Zhentarim: The Black Network has an open recruitment policy. Anyone can join. Tenacity and loyalty are highly valued (but not essential) traits in new members. The Zhentarim is a shadow organization that trades mercenaries and goods (including weapons) for profit.

## Lord's Alliance

[Jalester Silvermane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#LordsAlliance)

> “A gang war is causing unrest throughout the city. We have offered protection to members of the Dungsweepers’ Guild, and you have been assigned to protect a group of them. Meet them at the Muleskull Tavern, on Ship Street in the Dock Ward, at six bells and guard them while they work. Do this every day for a tenday.”

Each morning, the characters meet with a team of four dungsweepers (commoners) and head to the Trades Ward, where the sweepers spend the day cleaning up waste in the streets. It’s boring work. On the ninth day, around highsun, two carrion crawler emerges from a nearby alley, pursued by two City Watch guards. The characters can help slay the carrion crawler, which came up from the sewers.

- 2 Carrion Crawlers (p. 37)
- Happens on 9th day
- Jalester pays 300 gp

## Hydrathistle

There has been a shortage and the last time Fala tried to collect they were almost killed. Need you to escort them. 12 Stirges (p. 284) in a swamp outside town.
- Rewards with 400 gp worth of potions, or 200 gp cash

## [Quest to join Zhentarim](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#Zhentarim) (Tiddles, Doomhilda)

A flying snake with a parchment tied about its body visits one character in the dead of night. The message reads:

> “Want to be part of something big? Speak to Davil Starsong at the Yawning Portal.”

Yagra Stonefist greets them and leads interested parties to a table in the center of the Yawning Portal’s taproom, where her boss waits with drink in hand.

### Davil Starsong
[Davil Starsong](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149845-davil-starsong) is the characters’ primary contact in the Black Network, at least initially. Over drinks, he shares the following information:

- Davil is a retired adventurer. He and his adventuring companions joined the Zhentarim a few years back. They help people in need. (More specifically, they provide loans, mercenaries, and other services.)
- Another Black Network gang has recently infiltrated the city and tried to take over the Xanathar Guild. They failed, setting off a war in the streets. Davil and his colleagues want to end the violence and restore the peace.
- Davil offers membership in the faction to interested characters, then assigns them their first mission.

> “Someone is killing elf and half-elf sailors in the Dock Ward — three dead so far, each one decapitated by a blade in the dead of night. Look into it, will you? Methinks the City Watch could use a little help.”

Characters who spend three consecutive nights loitering around the docks spot Heldar, a drunk half-elf sailor (bandit), leaving the Muleskull Tavern (on Ship Street in the Dock Ward). Characters who follow Heldar can save him from Soluun Xibrindas, a renegade [drow gunslinger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149812-drow-gunslinger). Soluun hides in the shadows, blade drawn, waiting for the half-elf to stumble by. Spotting him before he strikes requires a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. Soluun flees if reduced to half his hit points or fewer.

Davil pays 300 gp, and gives a mystery key.

## [Emerald Enclave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#EmeraldEnclave) - Cat quest for Oleander / Mirage

Visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:

“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.

## Harpers - Who is the "most good" character? Who showed the most compassion toward Renaer?

Written on a paper bird:

> “Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance.”

Enclosed are tickets for the entire party to The Fall of Tiamat, an opera sung in Giant describing the evil dragon queen’s defeat at the Well of Dragons.
