## Changes

- Dalakhar stumbled upon the stone fragment and hastily headed to Backwash BnB. Maybe Renaer knows something, tried to dissuade Dalakhar?
- Maybe skip the whole Nimblewright fiasco
- Get the first 1/4 in Gralhund Villa
- Hear a screm outside the Villa

## [Emerald Enclave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#EmeraldEnclave) - Cat quest for Oleander / Mirage

Visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:

“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.

## Harpers

Written on a paper bird:

> “Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance.”

Enclosed are tickets for the entire party to The Fall of Tiamat, an opera sung in Giant describing the evil dragon queen’s defeat at the Well of Dragons.

- Phaulknonmere is anytime.
- Player's have just stepped through the door of Trollskull manor.

# Trollskull

There are 1d4 patrons. All are glumly drinking beer, and half are forcing down some chowder at (name). You head upstairs to rest for a moment (or whatever). Sitting in the common room, what do you discuss?

# Return to Fala

Fala doesn't remember them. Tries to sell potions.

> Welcome to the Corellon's Crown. We have potions of animal friendship, climbing, healing, greater healing. We are currently out of potions of water breathing due to the cripling hydrathistle shortage. Oh, it's you! I thought you would have surely perished, but I was willing to take that risk.

Reward: 100gp for each herb (or 150gp worth of potions).

# Opera - Harper's quest

- Warn players of dress code. 
- Players need fine clothes to gain admittance (15 gp in player's handbook).

## Clothes

You don't know anywhere that sells fine clothes. DC 15 check: Piatran's Clothiers is in the South Ward, Rebeleigh's Elegant Headwear is in the Castle Ward, and Meiroth's Fine Silks is in the Trades Ward.

## Bouncer

No problem if they're wearing fine clothes.

## To Private Box C

- Highest perception check: some shady figures, overhear "new Harper agents". They briefly turn their gaze towards your party. What do you do?
- Zhents do not know which box to look for.

## Private Box C

- An usher: ``tickets please''.
- The box is empty. A note is under one of the seats: "Find me at the after party in the grand ballroom. -M"

## After party

Another usher checks your tickets. You enter into a grand courtyard. Music is playing, and people are dancing. Partners are continually changing. Some people are standing around watching, talking, snacking.

- Dance of Many masks. There are just a few measures of music between each partner swap (about 30 seconds).
- After 1d10 partner changes, meet Mirt.
- Every 2 partner changes make a DC15 Performance check. After 3 consecutive fails, escorted off of the dance floor.

> Mirt slips 5 Harper pins and a note into their pocket. "You appear to have a knack for this type of thing, welcome to the Harpers! Report to me in my manor in the Sea Ward when you are done your mission. Be discrete about your visit."

With the pins in hand, all players are have 1 renown, and are Rank 1 Watchers.

> The note reads: “One of the drays working in the city is pulled by a talking mare named Maxeene. Locate her, find out if she’s learned the identity of any Zhent operatives, and if so, determine their whereabouts.”

## Maxeene

[Quest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#Harpers)

Characters can find Maxeene, a draft horse with an Intelligence score of 10, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Maxeene speaks Common, and characters must try to convince her that they’re Harpers by making a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the horse recalls giving a ride to a sun elf and his half-orc bodyguard two days ago; she picked them up at an intersection (she doesn’t recall which one) and dropped them off at the Yawning Portal. They talked about hiring spies to root out Xanathar Guild hideouts in the city. Maxeene’s descriptions of the passengers match the appearances of Davil Starsong and Yagra Stonefist. Reward: Each Harper character gains 1 renown.

[Davil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149845-davil-starsong)

- Mirt: excellent work, this is very interesting indeed...
- I will contact you via paper bird for your next mission.

# Order of the Gauntlet - Scarecrows

## Phaulkonmere - Jeryth Phaulkon
When the characters arrive at Phaulkonmere for the first time, Melannor introduces them to the lady of the estate: a noblewoman-turned-demigod and Chosen of Mielikki named Jeryth Phaulkon. Jeryth, the only member of her family who currently resides at Phaulkonmere, manifests as a disembodied female voice that can be heard by anyone in the villa gardens. She offers membership in the enclave and bestows on each new member a charm of restoration (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Jeryth also offers Phaulkonmere as a safe haven for enclave members and their friends.

In her disembodied state, Jeryth can’t be harmed. If the need arises, Jeryth can cast any spell on the druid spell list. She uses her spells in defense of her estate and its beautiful gardens. A member of the Emerald Enclave can petition Jeryth to cast a spell, which she is happy to do if that character’s renown in the enclave equals or exceeds the spell’s level.

## [Scarecrows](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/172842-improved-scarecrow)

- Just east of Waterdeep (Undercliff). Farms are scattered around the fields are in the process of being planted, but work has mostly been abandoned.
