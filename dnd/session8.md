## Intro

- Story recap: 1/2 million dragons were embezzled by the former and ousted open lord of Waterdeep: Dagult Neverember. The dragons were never recovered and are rumoured to exist within a vault in the city. By accident, you rescued Renaer Neverember, Dagults son. He was being held captive by some Zhentarim agents. They were interogating him about something called "The Stone of Golorr". It reputedly reveals the location of the stolen gold.
- Recap: Mirt (a wealthy noble and seemingly high-ranking Harper). 1 renown. You've been to his house, know where he lives. Harpers are a benvolent spy network.
- You defeated the Scarecrows. You returned to Phaulkonmere. Jeryth Phaulkon, 1 renown. You each are now low ranking members of the Emerald Enclave. Primarily druids and rangers that oppose threats to the natural world such as the undead, scarecrows, and _constructs (robots, automotons)_. _You can enquire about their services, and ask them for help._
- You are returning as the heroes of Willowton (Doomhilda seemed a little off). A Wyvern flies overhead. Encounter on a 1-2 from (d4/d6/d8) depending on how fast they travel. You arrive early/late/evening.
- There are 1d8 patrons, somewhat enjoying themselves. ``Where 'ave you been? Wages are due!'' pay 25gp. Now get $5 \times 1d20+1$gp (chowder was improved slightly). Roll twice because it feels like a lot of time has passed. You've run this for a month total.
- Everyone take a turn doing anything they want in the city. [Random conversations](https://www.dndspeak.com/2021/05/13/100-prompts-for-idle-chit-chat-between-characters/)

## Important Secrets

- Dalkhar had the stone of Golorr.
- The stone was taken by Urstul.
- Urstul is at Gralhund Villa.
- A nimblewright is a magical construct created to serve as a guard or assassin.
- The nimblewright hurled the fireball. He botched the attack, killed his allies.
- A nimblewright has been spotted at Gralhund Villa.
- Gralhund's have been working with the Zhents.

## Start

> You hear the sound of a massive blast and the sound of shattering glass as things crashes through your front windows. Your inn shakes and rattles. Charred bodies and anguished screams fly through the air. A thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward from the blast, which seems to have occurred right outside your door.

It is just before 8. What is your character doing and how do they react. Quick!

## Crime Scene

### BnB
- A fast character can look out the window and get a description of Urstul Floxin grabbing the stone and limping away toward the bent nail.
- A dead Zhent with tattoo blasted through the window. An elderly lady. Other smoldering pieces of debris. 

### Bodies:
- Two cloaked male humans (Zhent sellswords) clad in leather armor with sheathed longswords
- Two female humans and one male half-elf dressed in plain clothes (servants of wealthy North Ward families, killed while running errands)
- One male gnome (Dalakhar) wearing a burned cloak and clutching a dagger
- Avi the water genasi (Embric comes quickly to mourn)

### Before guards arrive (2 mins):

> The city guard is incoming.

A search of the bodies accompanied by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the following:

- One of the dead male humans has a flying snake tattooed on his right forearm.
- The dead gnome has dry waste on his boots and cloak, suggesting he has spent time in the sewers recently. He also has a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones.
- A character can try to snatch Dalakhar’s pouch without being seen by NPC onlookers, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the character still acquires the pouch, but someone observes the theft and reports it to City Watch constables once they show up (see “The Watch Arrives” below). This witness to the theft can be silenced with a bribe of 50 gp or more.

### Guards arrive

- Cordon off the alley.
- 6 guards at each entrance. Another 6 and a sergeant watch over the bodies.
- Waiting for the City Watch to arrive and investigate.
- Griffon cavalry rider circles the neighbourhood above, watching.
- Neighbours and onlookers are standing around the crime scene, crying/talking/watching.
- Who do you want to talk to?

### Eyewitnesses
Many other people witnessed the fireball without being caught in the blast. Three of them have important information to share.

#### Fala Lefaliir

> “I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn’t injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome, then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail.”

Fala saw Urstul Floxin fleeing the scene with the Stone of Golorr in his clutches. He circled around the Bent Nail (see chapter 2, area T2) on his way out of Trollskull Alley.

#### Jezrynne Hornraven
A Waterdavian born of wealth and privilege, Jezrynne was leaving the Tiger’s Eye (see chapter 2, area T5), having just hired Vincent Trench to spy on her philandering husband, when she witnessed the following:

> “I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!”

Jezrynne doesn’t know what the “puppet” hurled to cause the fireball. She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn’t know where it went.

#### Martem Trec
This 12-year-old boy watched as his halfling friends perished in the flames. He didn’t see much beyond that, but he found something important after the blast went off:

> “Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a ‘plop’ and found this in the barrel.”

Martem produces a necklace of fireballs with two beads remaining and a broken clasp. As it fled across a rooftop, the nimblewright accidentally yanked on the necklace, which came off, fell to the roof, slid off the edge, and plopped into the rain barrel next to Martem.

He doesn’t know what to make of this object but was planning to keep it. A character can snatch it from him or convince Martem to relinquish it with a successful DC 8 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.

### Watch arrives (20 mins)

City Watch sergeant Saeth Cromley escorts a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors named Barnibus Blastwind to the crime scene. Barnibus quietly takes charge of the investigation at that point, while Sergeant Cromley directs a force of twenty constables (veterans) to knock on doors and question locals.

Before allowing the corpses to be removed and taken to local temples, Barnibus inspects the scene closely and reaches the following conclusions, which he prefers to keep to himself but might share with other members of the Watchful Order:

- The gnome was running from 2 armed pursuers, who are dead. A third person swooped in right after the fireball.
- The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the tavern in Trollskull Alley (which Barnibus will soon come to realize is the characters’ property).
- Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the blast coming.

Given these findings, Barnibus decides to question the tavern’s owners and occupants, with Sergeant Cromley by his side as a witness and bodyguard. Specifically, Barnibus wants to find out the gnome’s identity and whether he was known to anyone. The characters, having never met Dalakhar, have little information to offer unless they decide to lie.

Neither Barnibus nor Sergeant Cromley is quick to jump to conclusions. They both prefer to have ironclad evidence and testimony from reliable witnesses before making any arrests. Even though the characters are suspects by virtue of their proximity to the crime scene, it hardly seems plausible that they would unleash destructive magic so close to their place of business in broad daylight. Consequently, Barnibus intends not to take up too much of their time.

Barnibus and Sergeant Cromley refuse requests by characters to join the investigation. “That would introduce too many new variables into an already confounding equation,” replies Barnibus with a frown. “Trust in the Watch,” Cromley adds dismissively.

> Characters who seem truthful and honest can press Barnibus for further information by making a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they nudge Barnibus into revealing what he has discovered, as outlined above.

> The Watch cast gentle repose spells on corpses to preserve them for 10 days to allow investigators to speak with them.

## Paths to Gralhund
- Emerald enclave knows that Gralhund's have a nimblewright. These things typically get wound up being used for evil. You should eliminate this unnatural and evil creature.
- Harpers (also Raener) know that Urstul Floxin, a high ranking Zhent, is operating out of Gralhund Villa for some reason.
- Everyone knows that they should inquire at the temple of Gond if they want to learn about nimblewrights. When they get to the temple, they acquire the nimblewright detector, and that can also lead them right to the Gralhunds’ doorstep.
- Can follow the description of a limping man to Gralhund Villa.
- Go to Watch headquarters and hire a priest to cast Speak With Dead.
- Vincent trench approaches them and asks what information they have about the perpetrators of the attack (investigating a dead wife). Trade notes.
- Renaer drops in if need be.

## Speaking with the victims

The dead are taken to a City Watch station in the North Ward and kept in a cellar morgue. Clerics from local temples are brought in to cast gentle repose spells on the corpses, to preserve them while the investigation is ongoing. Any character who has a renown of 1 or higher in Force Grey (the Gray Hands), the Harpers, the Lords’ Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, or the Zhentarim can petition their faction representative to hire a cleric to cast speak with dead on one or more of the fatalities. The characters can hire a cleric themselves by making a donation of at least 25 gp to the cleric’s temple for each casting of the spell. They must also provide a list of questions they want answered.

A speak with dead spell can pry some or all of the following information from Dalakhar’s corpse if the right questions are asked:

- Dalakhar stole an artifact called the Stone of Golorr from the lair of a beholder known as Xanathar, in a dungeon deep below the city.
- Dalakhar worked for the Open Lord of Waterdeep. (Here he refers to Lord Dagult Neverember, whom he believes is the rightful Open Lord, not Laeral Silverhand.)
- The Stone of Golorr is the key to finding a hoard of dragons hidden in the city.
- Dalakhar heard about a group of adventurers who rescued Lord Neverember’s son from the Zhentarim and thought the Stone of Golorr would be safe in their hands for the time being. He was on his way to deliver it to them, planning to come back and reclaim it after he had eluded his pursuers. Then the fireball went off.

The following information can be learned by casting speak with dead on one or both of the dead Zhentarim sellswords:

- Their names were Bashekk Ortallis and Wern Malkrave. They worked for Urstul Floxin and resided at Gralhund Villa.
- Their job was to help catch a gnome named Dalakhar.
- Dalakhar had some kind of artifact in his possession which, according to Urstul Floxin, would make them as rich as kings.

## Renaer

Drop into tavern. If he’s told that a gnome and two Zhents were killed in the blast, Renaer drops a bombshell:

> When the Lords of Waterdeep ousted my father, I thought his long, dark shadow was finally gone for good. The truth is, I want nothing to do with him. But his spies hound me. One of them, a gnome named Dalakhar, had been watching me for months. Then, about two tendays ago, the spy was suddenly nowhere to be seen. My father didn’t trust many people, but he trusted that gnome. I spoke to a few of Dalakhar’s friends. Apparently, he was on a special mission to retrieve theStone of Golorr and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the Stone of Golorr to my father in Neverwinter.

If the characters tell Renaer that Fala Lefaliir saw a man fleeing Trollskull Alley (see “Eyewitnesses”), Renaer reaches out to his friends in the Harpers. A day later, he returns with the following information:

- The man Fala saw matches the description of Urstul Floxin, a suspected member of the Black Network.
- Another North Ward resident claims he saw Urstul enter Gralhund Villa, in the North Ward, shortly after the fireball incident. The resident reported him to the City Watch because Urstul looked suspicious.
- Two City Watch constables spoke to Lord Gralhund. He assured them that no one had broken into the estate and that everything was fine. The constables had no grounds to get a search warrant, so they didn’t pursue the matter.

## Temple of Gond (house of inspired hands)

> The House of Inspired Hands, Waterdeep’s temple of Gond, sits on the corner of Seawatch Street and Shark Street in the Sea Ward. The House of Inspired Hands looks like a cross between a temple and a workshop. The symbol of Gond, a toothed cog with four spokes, is displayed prominently.
> The main hall of the temple holds two dozen marble pedestals. Each one bears a prize-winning invention or a miniature model of some other extraordinary creation.
> You are met by Valetta, a dragonborn priest of bronze dragon ancenstry. ``The temple of Gond welcomes you. How may I serve you?''

A wayward nimblewright, gifted to the temple by a wizard, has gone missing.

If character's say that a nimblewright threw a fireball: get nimblewright detector and 500gp if they destroy the creature. Detector: crystal ball with a piece of nimblewright that rotates faster the closer it gets.

## Gralhund Villa

- Breaking into the Villa from south is possible, but people take notice and will call the watch.
- May hear a scream from within the Villa to encourage them to enter.
- Standing outside too long, neighbours notice (percepetion check).
- G8: At least 6 thugs. First thug takes a turn (DC 13 perception check) and calls out the squishiest member. Random on a fail.
