## Changes

- Dalakhar was working for Xanathar, stold the stone, and was being pursued by _Xanathar_ guild members.
- Urstul and Nimblewright (Zhentarim) coordinated the attack. Either lead to Gralhund.
- Urstul will escape via portal with the stone.

## Intro

- Recap Mirt (a wealthy noble and seemingly high-ranking Harper). Gained membership to Harpers. You've been to his house, know where he lives. Harpers are a benvolent spy network.
- You defeated the Scarecrows. You returned to Phaulkonmere. You each are now low ranking members of the Emerald Enclave. Primarily druids and rangers that oppose threats to the natural world such as the undead, scarecrows, and _constructs (robots, automotons)_. _You can enquire about their services, and ask them for help._
- You return as the heroes of Willowton (Doomhilda seemed a little off). A Wyvern flies overhead. Encounter on a 1-2 from (d4/d6/d8) depending on how fast they travel. You arrive early/late/evening.
- There are 1d8 patrons, somewhat enjoying themselves. ``Where 'ave you been? Wages are due!'' pay 25gp. Now get $5 \times 1d20+1$gp (chowder was improved slightly). Roll twice because it feels like a lot of time has passed. You've run this thing for a month.
- Everyone take a turn doing anything they want in the city. [Random conversations](https://www.dndspeak.com/2021/05/13/100-prompts-for-idle-chit-chat-between-characters/)

## Start

> You hear the sound of a massive blast and the sound of shattering glass as things crashes through your front windows. Your inn shakes and rattles. Charred bodies and anguished screams fly through the air. A thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward from the blast, which seems to have occurred right outside your door.

It is just before 8. What is your character doing and how do they react. Quick!

## Crime Scene

- A fast character can look out the window and get a description of Urstul Floxin grabbing the stone and limping away toward the bent nail.
- A dead sellsword with tattoo blasted through the window. Other smoldering pieces of 

### Bodies:
- Two cloaked male humans (_Xanathar_ sellswords) clad in leather armor with sheathed longswords
- Two female humans and one male half-elf dressed in plain clothes (servants of wealthy North Ward families, killed while running errands)
- One male gnome (Dalakhar) wearing a burned cloak and clutching a dagger
- Avi the water genasi (Embric comes quickly to mourn)

### Before guards arrive (2 mins):

A search of the bodies accompanied by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the following:

- One of the dead male humans has a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference tattooed on his right forearm.
- The dead gnome has dry waste on his boots and cloak, suggesting he has spent time in the sewers recently. He also has a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones.
- A character can try to snatch Dalakhar’s pouch without being seen by NPC onlookers, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the character still acquires the pouch, but someone observes the theft and reports it to City Watch constables once they show up (see “The Watch Arrives” below). This witness to the theft can be silenced with a bribe of 50 gp or more.

### Guards arrive

- Cordon off the alley.
- 6 guards at each entrance. Another 6 and a sergeant watch over the bodies until the City Watch arrives.
- Griffon cavalry rider circles the neighbourhood above, watching.

### Watch arrives (20 mins)

City Watch sergeant Saeth Cromley escorts a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors named Barnibus Blastwind to the crime scene. Barnibus quietly takes charge of the investigation at that point, while Sergeant Cromley directs a force of twenty constables (veterans) to knock on doors and question locals.

Before allowing the corpses to be removed and taken to local temples, Barnibus inspects the scene closely and reaches the following conclusions, which he prefers to keep to himself but might share with other members of the Watchful Order:

- The gnome was running from 2 armed pursuers, who are dead. A third person swooped in right after the fireball.
- The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the tavern in Trollskull Alley (which Barnibus will soon come to realize is the characters’ property).
- Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the blast coming.

Given these findings, Barnibus decides to question the tavern’s owners and occupants, with Sergeant Cromley by his side as a witness and bodyguard. Specifically, Barnibus wants to find out the gnome’s identity and whether he was known to anyone. The characters, having never met Dalakhar, have little information to offer unless they decide to lie.

Neither Barnibus nor Sergeant Cromley is quick to jump to conclusions. They both prefer to have ironclad evidence and testimony from reliable witnesses before making any arrests. Even though the characters are suspects by virtue of their proximity to the crime scene, it hardly seems plausible that they would unleash destructive magic so close to their place of business in broad daylight. Consequently, Barnibus intends not to take up too much of their time.

Barnibus and Sergeant Cromley refuse requests by characters to join the investigation. “That would introduce too many new variables into an already confounding equation,” replies Barnibus with a frown. “Trust in the Watch,” Cromley adds dismissively. Characters who seem truthful and honest can press Barnibus for further information by making a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they nudge Barnibus into revealing what he has discovered, as outlined above.

The Watch cast gentle repose spells on corpses to preserve them for 10 days to allow investigators to speak with them.

### Eyewitnesses
Many other people witnessed the fireball without being caught in the blast. Three of them have important information to share.

#### Fala Lefaliir

> “I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn’t injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome, then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail.”

Fala saw Urstul Floxin fleeing the scene with the Stone of Golorr in his clutches. He circled around the Bent Nail (see chapter 2, area T2) on his way out of Trollskull Alley.

#### Jezrynne Hornraven
A Waterdavian born of wealth and privilege, Jezrynne was leaving the Tiger’s Eye (see chapter 2, area T5), having just hired Vincent Trench to spy on her philandering husband, when she witnessed the following:

> “I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!”

Jezrynne doesn’t know what the “puppet” hurled to cause the fireball. She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn’t know where it went.

#### Martem Trec
This 12-year-old boy watched as his halfling friends perished in the flames. He didn’t see much beyond that, but he found something important after the blast went off:

> “Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a ‘plop’ and found this in the barrel.”

Martem produces a necklace of fireballs with two beads remaining and a broken clasp. As it fled across a rooftop, the nimblewright accidentally yanked on the necklace, which came off, fell to the roof, slid off the edge, and plopped into the rain barrel next to Martem.

He doesn’t know what to make of this object but was planning to keep it. A character can snatch it from him or convince Martem to relinquish it with a successful DC 8 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.

## Paths to Gralhund
- Emerald enclave knows that Gralhund's have a robot. These things typically get wound up being used for evil. You should eliminate this unnatural and evil creature.
- Harpers (also Raener) know that Urstul Floxin, a high ranking Zhent, is operating out of Gralhund Villa for some reason.
- Everyone knows that they should inquire at the temple of Gond if they want to learn about nimblewrights. When they get to the temple, they acquire the nimblewright detector, and that can also lead them right to the Gralhunds’ doorstep.
- Can follow the description of a limping man to Gralhund Villa.
- Go to Watch headquarters and hire a priest to cast Speak With Dead.
- Vincent trench approaches them and asks what information they have about the perpetrators of the attack (investigating a dead wife). Trade notes.

### Future sessions
- Catch Urstul immeidately. Get stone. Stone whispers to a single player the location, player is unable to communicate the location: DC CON save they throw up trying. Player forgets the location as soon as stone is passed.
- Keys are in 2 diff lairs, need to heist them.

## Gralhund Villa

- Breaking into the Villa from south is possible, but people take notice and will call the watch. Hint they come back at night.
- Get the first 1/4 in Gralhund Villa
- Hear a scream outside the Villa
- Standing outside too long, neighbours notice (percepetion check)
- G8: At least 6 thugs. First thug takes a turn (DC 13 perception check) and calls out the squishiest member. Random on a fail.

## [Emerald Enclave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#EmeraldEnclave) - Cat quest for Oleander / Mirage

Visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:

“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.

## Harpers

Written on a paper bird:

> “Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance.”

Enclosed are tickets for the entire party to The Fall of Tiamat, an opera sung in Giant describing the evil dragon queen’s defeat at the Well of Dragons.

[Alley shops](https://rtgodwin.com/alley/)

# Opera - Harper's quest

- Warn players of dress code. 
- Players need fine clothes to gain admittance (15 gp in player's handbook).

## Clothes

You don't know anywhere that sells fine clothes. DC 15 check: Piatran's Clothiers is in the South Ward, Rebeleigh's Elegant Headwear is in the Castle Ward, and Meiroth's Fine Silks is in the Trades Ward.

## Bouncer

No problem if they're wearing fine clothes.

## To Private Box C

- Highest perception check: some shady figures, overhear "new Harper agents". They briefly turn their gaze towards your party. What do you do?
- Zhents do not know which box to look for.

## Private Box C

- An usher: ``tickets please''.
- The box is empty. A note is under one of the seats: "Find me at the after party in the grand ballroom. -M"

## After party

Another usher checks your tickets. You enter into a grand courtyard. Music is playing, and people are dancing. Partners are continually changing. Some people are standing around watching, talking, snacking.

- Dance of Many masks. There are just a few measures of music between each partner swap (about 30 seconds).
- After 1d10 partner changes, meet Mirt.
- Every 2 partner changes make a DC15 Performance check. After 3 consecutive fails, escorted off of the dance floor.

> Mirt slips 5 Harper pins and a note into their pocket. "You appear to have a knack for this type of thing, welcome to the Harpers! Report to me in my manor in the Sea Ward when you are done your mission. Be discrete about your visit."

With the pins in hand, all players are have 1 renown, and are Rank 1 Watchers.

> The note reads: “One of the drays working in the city is pulled by a talking mare named Maxeene. Locate her, find out if she’s learned the identity of any Zhent operatives, and if so, determine their whereabouts.”

## Maxeene

[Quest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#Harpers)

Characters can find Maxeene, a draft horse with an Intelligence score of 10, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Maxeene speaks Common, and characters must try to convince her that they’re Harpers by making a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the horse recalls giving a ride to a sun elf and his half-orc bodyguard two days ago; she picked them up at an intersection (she doesn’t recall which one) and dropped them off at the Yawning Portal. They talked about hiring spies to root out Xanathar Guild hideouts in the city. Maxeene’s descriptions of the passengers match the appearances of Davil Starsong and Yagra Stonefist. Reward: Each Harper character gains 1 renown.

[Davil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149845-davil-starsong)

- Mirt: excellent work, this is very interesting indeed...
- I will contact you via paper bird for your next mission.

# Order of the Gauntlet - Scarecrows

## Phaulkonmere - Jeryth Phaulkon
When the characters arrive at Phaulkonmere for the first time, Melannor introduces them to the lady of the estate: a noblewoman-turned-demigod and Chosen of Mielikki named Jeryth Phaulkon. Jeryth, the only member of her family who currently resides at Phaulkonmere, manifests as a disembodied female voice that can be heard by anyone in the villa gardens. She offers membership in the enclave and bestows on each new member a charm of restoration (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Jeryth also offers Phaulkonmere as a safe haven for enclave members and their friends.

In her disembodied state, Jeryth can’t be harmed. If the need arises, Jeryth can cast any spell on the druid spell list. She uses her spells in defense of her estate and its beautiful gardens. A member of the Emerald Enclave can petition Jeryth to cast a spell, which she is happy to do if that character’s renown in the enclave equals or exceeds the spell’s level.

## [Scarecrows](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/172842-improved-scarecrow)

- Just east of Waterdeep (Undercliff). Farms are scattered around the fields are in the process of being planted, but work has mostly been abandoned.
