# Day 1
Spend the afternoon leveling up.
- Doomhilda finds herself inexplicably drawn to a nearby swamp just outside the city.
- Any small jobs you want to do?

# Fencing goods aboard the Black Swan

## Heading to Alline’s Way
- On foot (normal): 47 minutes
- On foot (fast): 35 minutes
- On foot (slow): 70 minutes

> Supposed to meet at 11pm. When do you leave?
> At night, there are mostly only city watch and lamplighters out.

## Guards

Either group stealth against patrol of guards or “take the lead”, DC 12.
> FAIL: You come face to face with a patrol of guards as you round a corner. “Where are you headed?” -> Performance/deception DC 12 for weak roleplayers.
> FAIL: "Do we need robes here?" A Magister confiscates their contraband and charges them a fine of 500 gp.

## Being followed

Group make a perception check. DC 16: Further along as the alleys grow darker you notice someone following you. (Jareth).

## To the Black Swan

You meet Baziff Elest at Alline’s Way near Dock Street.

> “You’re just on-time/late. Come this way. Quickly! Captain Blackthorn is not one to be kept waiting!”

> As you walk he reminds you that his finders fee is 10% and that he won't argue this in front of Captain Blackthorn. 

> The Black Swan is a sleek, two-masted ship with a dark, weathered hull and black sails adorned with a faintly visible silver swan emblem. The ship's deck is well-maintained, with neatly coiled ropes and organized cargo. Sailors glance at you with ambivalence, ignoring you mostly. Baziff nods at a crew member standing guard. You descend into the lower cabin.

## Captain Blackthorn
Captain Morlina Blackthorn sits behind a desk, raven-black hair tied back in a neat braid. A jagged scar cuts across her weather-beaten face, hinting at past battles and close encounters with death. Clad in worn leather armor adorned with trinkets from her travels, she carries a cutlass on her hip, its hilt encrusted with jewels.

_Persuasion checks at disadvantage._

> “(You're late!) (You're on time) and my time is valuable. Let's make this quick. What is it you wish to sell?”

_A dwarf named Haldor Iron-Eye waddles over and examines the contraband. Minutes pass, Haldor whispers to Captain Blathorn._

> These bars are of course stamped Neverwinter and can only be sold in Neverwinter. Luckily for you I have a ship and I can sail these stolen items there myself, but I must be paid for my time and for the risk I must take. I can offer you 500 gp. The paintings, alas, are fake, but nonetheless I can offer you 200 gp for the lot.

> Who is paying attention? Make an insight check against Morlina's Deception +8. Call her out/ persuade -> 800 gp each.

> "There is of course the matter of the finders fee. Baziff, how much are you owed?" She tosses Baziff 10%.

> Who is carrying the gold?

### Contraband
- 15 - 10lb. silver bars (50 gp ea., 750 gp total)
- 4 paintings (300 gp ea.). The paintings were created by the renowned Elven artist, Elandrial Silverbrush.
- 1950 gp total.

## Exit

Ambushed by Shadowspine Thugs. Same figure that was tailing you (Jareth). Follow printout.

# Day 2

> Word begins to spread throughout Waterdeep that a group of adventurers helped Volothamp Geddarm and rescued Renaer Neverember. Within days, faction representatives are going to begin to approach you to try to recruit you.

## Morning:

PCs approached by a halfling named Broxley Fairkettle who informs you that if you are intending on running a Tavern you must register with the Tavernkeepers' guild.

> Welcome to the Neighborhood! I just wanted to stop by and introduce myself, I'm Broxley Fairkettle, from the Fellowship of Innkeepers, it looks as if Volo has given up on his little tavern project, are you the new owners?"

> “Have you had a chance to call your local Guild reps to have them look at costs for repairs? Also if you are to run a Tavern you'll need to be a member of the Fellowship of Innkeepers, of course. I'd be happy to offer my assistance with contacting Reps to come out and bid for repairs, after your membership is paid for, obviously.”

> "Only 1 gp a tenday for membership. Also if you are brewing your own alcohol then I'd suggest you join the "Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild" Your alcohol will gain traction a lot quicker in the city, better distribution, and the members are more than happy to share secrets of the trade to make it better. If you are going to be cooking food I'd suggest you go through the Guild of Bakers to buy your bread and other cooking product, produce you can get from the open market."

# Quests

Looking for money? Many factions in Waterdeep.

- Emerald Enclave: an interest in protecting nature or the natural order to join the Emerald Enclave. Druids and rangers are especially welcome.
- Harpers: Any smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of Waterdeep. Bards and wizards are especially welcome.
- Lord's Alliance: To become a member of the Lords’ Alliance faction in Waterdeep, a character must be a Waterdavian citizen. Those with criminal records can also join, provided they demonstrate their allegiance to the city.
- Xanathar Guild: Anyone can join the Xanathar Guild, which, despite its name, doesn’t have official guild status in Waterdeep. Before membership is granted, however, an applicant must pass a test that always involves the perpetration of a serious crime. Possibilities include murdering a guild member who has failed Xanathar in some fashion, kidnapping a Waterdavian citizen, collecting a ransom, robbing a hire-coach, or looting a warehouse.
- Zhentarim: The Black Network has an open recruitment policy. Anyone can join. Tenacity and loyalty are highly valued (but not essential) traits in new members. The Zhentarim is a shadow organization that trades mercenaries and goods (including weapons) for profit.

## Hydrathistle

There has been a shortage and the last time Fala tried to collect they were almost killed. Need you to escort them. 12 Stirges in a swamp outside town.



Start asking around for a fence - Zhentarim or Xanathar guild. Need to be a member.

## Buy some poison

Poison is expensive because it is highly illegal, although it is a relatively simple formula. Lesser Poison, Vial (25 GP). One use, DC 12 Constitution, for 1d4 damage. Can ask Fala how to make it for a cheaper source.

DC17 Investigation: find it. Otherwise, must join Zhentarim guild to obtain it (although they don't sell it openly).

## Quest to join Zhentarim

A flying snake with a parchment tied about its body visits one character in the dead of night. The message reads:

> “Want to be part of something big? Speak to Davil Starsong at the Yawning Portal.”

Yagra Stonefist greets them and leads interested parties to a table in the center of the Yawning Portal’s taproom, where her boss waits with drink in hand.

### Davil Starsong
[Davil Starsong](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149845-davil-starsong) is the characters’ primary contact in the Black Network, at least initially. Over drinks, he shares the following information:

- Davil is a retired adventurer. He and his adventuring companions joined the Zhentarim a few years back. They help people in need. (More specifically, they provide loans, mercenaries, and other services.)
- Another Black Network gang has recently infiltrated the city and tried to take over the Xanathar Guild. They failed, setting off a war in the streets. Davil and his colleagues want to end the violence and restore the peace.
- Davil offers membership in the faction to interested characters, then assigns them their first mission.

> “Someone is killing elf and half-elf sailors in the Dock Ward — three dead so far, each one decapitated by a blade in the dead of night. Look into it, will you? Methinks the City Watch could use a little help.”

Characters who spend three consecutive nights loitering around the docks spot Heldar, a drunk half-elf sailor (bandit), leaving the Muleskull Tavern (on Ship Street in the Dock Ward). Characters who follow Heldar can save him from Soluun Xibrindas, a renegade drow gunslinger (see appendix B). Soluun hides in the shadows, blade drawn, waiting for the half-elf to stumble by. Spotting him before he strikes requires a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. Soluun flees if reduced to half his hit points or fewer.

## Emerald Enclave - Cat quest for Oleander / Mirage

Visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:

“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.

## Harpers - Who is the "most good" character? Who showed the most compassion toward Renaer?

Written on a paper bird:

> “Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance.”

Enclosed are tickets for the entire party to The Fall of Tiamat, an opera sung in Giant describing the evil dragon queen’s defeat at the Well of Dragons.

## Lord's Alliance

Jalester:

> “A gang war is causing unrest throughout the city. We have offered protection to members of the Dungsweepers’ Guild, and you have been assigned to protect a group of them. Meet them at the Muleskull Tavern, on Ship Street in the Dock Ward, at six bells and guard them while they work. Do this every day for a tenday.”

Actually an Order of the Gauntlet mission:

> “We hear that the Zhents are paying gangs in the Field Ward to attack suspected Xanathar Guild members. Fights are breaking out in the ward daily. Stop a fight before it happens. We need to send a message to these thugs that further altercations won’t be tolerated.”
