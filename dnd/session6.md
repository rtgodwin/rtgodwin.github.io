## [Emerald Enclave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/trollskull-alley#EmeraldEnclave) - Cat quest for Oleander / Mirage

Visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:

“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.

## Harpers - Who is the "most good" character? Who showed the most compassion toward Renaer?

Written on a paper bird:

> “Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance.”

Enclosed are tickets for the entire party to The Fall of Tiamat, an opera sung in Giant describing the evil dragon queen’s defeat at the Well of Dragons.

# Travelling

- Every time you travel through the city during the day, roll 1d6 for each ward you pass through (max 1 event). On a 6, a random encounter occurs.

# Trollskull

There are 1d4 patrons. All are glumly drinking beer, and half are forcing down some chowder at (name). You head upstairs to rest for a moment (or whatever). Sitting in the common room, what do you discuss?

# Return to Fala

Fala doesn't remember them. Tries to sell potions.

> Welcome to the Corellon's Crown. We have potions of animal friendship, climbing, healing, greater healing. We are currently out of potions of water breathing due to the cripling hydrathistle shortage. Oh, it's you! I thought you would have surely perished, but I was willing to take that risk.

Reward: 100gp for each herb (or 150gp worth of potions).
