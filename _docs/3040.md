<!---The TA, Adefikunola Adetoro, is holding weekly office hours from 10:00 - 11:00 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays. [Here is the Microsoft Teams link to join the office hour.](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZmNiMDU0NTItODQ5ZS00MWU5LTk1NmUtMWMyMzA4ODIwODQ1%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%224f80dd0b-338c-4e4c-8a14-90446962f7b8%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2254b69181-75bc-47eb-b526-ac70e8a437c3%22%7d)

Here is the R code I used in class on Sept. 24:

```r
# Load the data
mydata <- read.csv("https://rtgodwin.com/data/vidsales.csv")

# Make a sub-sample
sub <- subset(mydata, mydata$Publisher == "Nintendo" | mydata$Publisher == "Microsoft Game Studios")

# Create a variable to choose colour in the scatterplot
sub$mycol <- "red"
sub$mycol[sub$Publisher == "Microsoft Game Studios"] <- "blue"

# Create scatterplot
plot(sub$Score, sub$Sales, col = sub$mycol)
```

 **The first assignment** is due on September 24th. You need to use RStudio. Do [computer lab 1](https://rtgodwin.com/3040/lab1/), watch the [video for computer lab 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXToeZnajco), and make sure you can install and use RStudio well before September 24th.
