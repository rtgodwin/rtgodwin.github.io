## Announcements

Chapter 10 on instrumental variables has been added to the textbook.
{: .notice--info}

A new grading option is available:

| Assessment                   	| Weight 	| New Weight |
|:-----------------------------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| Assignments                  	| 15%    	| 15%        |
| Midterm Exam<br>(October 20) 	| 35%    	| 25%        |
| Final Exam                   	| 50%    	| 60%        |

Your final grade will automatically be calculated under both options, and the highest grade will be used. You do not need to email me to ask me for the new weighting option.

**The deadline for the first assignment** has moved to September 25th, due to the delay on the Lab 1 video being posted.

**The first three lectures will proceed as follows:**
1. Introduce the course, and R (which will be used for data analysis). This covers chapter 1 of the textbook.
2. Chapter 2 - probability review.
3. Chapter 3 - statistics review.

Lectures 2 and 3 will move very quickly, and cover a lot of material.
