This tutorial will go through all the code you need for assignment 1.

# Simple arithmetic

You can perform arithmetic to saved objects:

    a <- 2
    b <- 3
    c <- 4
    a + b * c

    ## [1] 14

# Load data

For an example dataset, I will load the Cobb-Douglas data directly from
the internet:

    mydat <- read.csv("https://rtgodwin.com/data/cobbdouglas.csv")

Note that you can load any `.csv` dataset this way, by typing the
location of the file in the quotations above.

# Calculate a sample mean

The sample mean for my dependent variable ,`log(output)`, is:

    mean(log(mydat$output))

    ## [1] 9.770502

Note that the `mydat$` part is telling R where to find the variable
`output`.

# Estimate and save a model

I will estimate the Cobb-Douglas production function, and save it as an
“object”. I can choose any name for the object (I choose “mymod”):

    mymod <- lm(log(output) ~ log(labour) + log(capital), data = mydat)

# Use the estimated model

To see the results of the estimation you can use `summary(mymod)` to see
lots of information, but if you just want to see the estimated **β**,
run `mymod`:

    mymod

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = log(output) ~ log(labour) + log(capital), data = mydat)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##  (Intercept)   log(labour)  log(capital)  
    ##       0.1768        0.2652        0.9121

To get, and save, the LS residuals from the estimated model, use:

    myresids <- residuals(mymod)

To get the estimated coefficients from the model use:

    coefficients(mymod)

    ##  (Intercept)  log(labour) log(capital) 
    ##    0.1768209    0.2651853    0.9121483

and to get only the estimate for labour (for example), extract the 2nd
element:

    coefficients(mymod)[2]

    ## log(labour) 
    ##   0.2651853

# Estimation without an intercept

Usually, it’s a good idea to include an intercept in the model, but
sometimes we don’t want it. R includes an intercept by default. To get
rid of the intercept, put `-1` at the end of the equation:

    lm(output ~ labour + capital -1, data = mydat)

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = output ~ labour + capital - 1, data = mydat)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##  labour  capital  
    ##  42.914    1.621

(I omitted the `log` for simplicity).
