## Course Description

The principal objective of this course is to provide a basic introduction to econometric theory and its application. Much of the emphasis of the course is on the single-equation linear multiple regression model, under both standard and non-standard assumptions. We will be considering some of the merits and weaknesses of traditional methods of inference in the context of this model. This course is also concerned with some of the very basic approaches to identifying and handling violations of the assumptions associated with the specification of the classical multiple regression model, and some of its extensions. The course will conclude with a different estimation method: Maximum Likelihood.

## Evaluation

| Assessment                   	| Weight 	|
|------------------------------	|--------	|
| Assignments                  	| 15%    	|
| Midterm Exam<br>(October 20) 	| 30%    	|
| Final Exam                   	| 55%    	|

### Assignments

There will be 5 assignments, each worth 3% of your grade. You will use RStudio and work with data in order to complete your assignments. All assignments must be completed independently.

### Midterm and Final

These will be closed book exams. The midterm will take place in the regular class room/time. The final exam will be scheduled by the university. The final exam is *cumulative*.

## Grading

Each piece of assessment in the course will be graded on a percentage scale, according to a grading scheme. The percentage marks will then be weighted, as above, into a single numerical score that will be converted to a letter grade as follows:

|     F     |     D     |     C     |     C+    |     B     |     B+    |     A     |     A+     |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
|  0% - 50% | 50% - 57% | 57% - 64% | 64% - 71% | 71% - 78% | 78% - 84% | 85% - 92% | 92% - 100% |

Students appealing any term work (including, assignments, midterm, final exam) whether it be an informal or formal appeal must appeal their term work within 10 working days of receiving their mark. All final grades are subject to departmental approval.

A missed assessment will result in make-up work, or reweighting of your grade.

Nov. 22, 2022, is the last day for voluntary withdrawal from the course.

## Academic Integrity

*	All assignments and exams must be completed independently.
*	Do not engage in “contract” cheating.
*	Do not provide your UM Learn login information to anyone else. This is “personation”, a serious form of academic misconduct.

Ignorance is not a defense. Familiarize yourself with section 2.5 of Academic Misconduct Procedures.

## Student Accessibility Services
Students with disabilities should contact Student Accessibility Services to facilitate the implementation of accommodations, and meet with me to discuss the accommodations recommended by Student Accessibility Services.

**Regulations Regarding the Retention and Disposal of Term Work** Information regarding the breakdown of grades assigned to a student in a given course (i.e., grades assigned for term work, class participation, final examination, etc.) must be retained by the instructor and/or the respective department for three years following the end of term in which the course was taken. No student will be permitted to submit term work for assessment to the instructor (and term work should not be returned to students) by any means which allows unrestricted and unauthorized public access to the term work. For example, term papers, term tests or other written assignments should not be received or returned from a box outside the instructor’s office door, but a student could provide a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of the term work. Unreturned term work must be kept in a secure and confidential department area for a minimum of four (4) months following the end of the course and until destroyed by confidential measures. The Final day of the University’s Final Examination period each term is considered as the last day of the term. Instructors shall include on their course outlines a statement to the effect that unreturned term work will become the property of the Faculty of Arts and will be subject to confidential destruction.
