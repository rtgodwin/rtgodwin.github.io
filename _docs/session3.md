# Recap

It has been a long night. 2 AM. You returned Floon. Volo has offered you the deed to Trollskull Manor. He explains that it is a good property with much potential. He intended on using it as research for a book, but alas he finds himself illiquid and must offer you this property in lieu.

Haunting: Awhile ago, the owners of the Trollskull Manor taproom _disappeared_. More recently, neighbours have complained to the city watch of haunting (who have draggged their heels, given the increasing gang violence). Volo has yet to make it past the entrance.

Purchase: Those who wish to be on the deed must accompany me to the Castle Ward, for the signing to be witnessed by a Magistrate. Magistrate Kylynne Silmerhelve. Sign the deed with the pen and inkwell.

# Trollskull Manor outisde

- 45 min walk from Yawing Portal.
- The neighbourhood is quiet, respectable, and even vibrant. There are several other businesses and establishments in the Alley.
- Four stories tall and boasting balconies, a turret, and five chimneys, the abandoned building is one of the grandest in Trollskull Alley.

## Secrets
- The house is haunted by two beings: Lif who is a harmless spectre, and his wife Falenas who is a deadly [Banshee](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17089-banshee).
- Falenas and Lif were killed by the assassin that Falenas hired.

# Trollskull Manor inside

- Tavern’s taproom is filled with broken furniture, tarnished silverware, casks of wine that have turned to vinegar.

## Exploring the manor
- Who is exploring and doing what. Do they split up?
  - doors slam open and shut
  - plate smashes
  - "Closing time" and "last call" in the dust
  - Mug rises from the shelf, and is hurled at you - what do you do?
  - Hand reaches out from a painting and tries to grab you.
  - Hear a bone shattering wail once per day. (Every 5 mins roll a d20 - on a 19/20 hear it).
  - A few bones of small animals littered around, cats, a giant rat, and birds it looks like (from mimic)

## Mimic
- In an upper room, a closet in pretty good condition. As soon as PC approached, is grappled by a [Mimic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mimic#content)

## Basement
- Two graves, Lif and Falenas. Dead for 6 months.

## Banshee
- Attic room contains Banshee. She hired an assassin to kill Lif, who also killed her and robbed the place.
- Warning message on door. Elven: Don't open. Banshee! (Lif wrote it).
- Room is magically sealed.
- There are two attic windows sealed up with boards (AC 10 - 6 HP each) that can flood the attic with sunlight - prevents Wail and takes Banshee to 29 HP.

## Lif

Lif is a poltergeist. He will like and aid PCs that begin to fix the place up. He will then warn characters of rats and mimic.

## Tavernkeepers' Guild

# Trollskull Alley

## The Bent Nail
A small wooden sign above this shop’s main door is bare except for a large, bent nail sticking out of it. The front room contains displays of ornate wooden furniture, as well as a selection of bows and crossbows. The wall behind the counter is lined with rows of finely carved wooden canes, quarterstaffs, and shields.

Talisolvanar “Tally” Fellbranch (CG), the owner and chief artisan of the Bent Nail, is a male half-elf carpenter and woodcarver. He is a commoner, with these changes:

Tally sells wooden weapons and shields at normal cost. He also crafts and sells furniture and wood sculptures.

## Steam and Steel
During daylight hours, smoke and steam billow from the many windows around this indoor forge where metal weapons, armor, and tools are made. The forge is owned and operated by a married couple: a fire genasi named Embric and a water genasi named Avi. Both are members of the Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers. As an armorer, Avi also belongs to the Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths.

> You see a fire Genasi (efreet) blasting some metal with produce flame and pounding on it with big sweaty muscles, and then a water Genasi (djinn) shaping water from a bucket and cooling the metal.

Embric (NG) tends the forge and is an expert weaponsmith. He claims descent from the efreet of Calimshan and is prone to extreme mood swings.

Avi (NG) worships Eldath, god of peace, and uses his magic to quench hot steel. He is an expert armorsmith. Avi is laid back and speaks plainly.

### Services
The genasi couple sells all metal weapons, armor, and shields listed in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook at normal cost.

## Corellon's Crown

Fala Lefaliir (non-binary, friends with a Zhent).

> Herbalism and apothecary shop. There is a sign associating it with the Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians. Three-story town house, the third floor of which has been converted into a greenhouse. Its translucent glass walls allow anyone on the street to see the rainbow of flowers blossoming within.

> You are greeted by a Wood Elf. "You bought the Manor, yes? You planning on fixing that place up? Pretty sure it's haunted, you must be very brave. If you're looking for potions, we have:"

- Quest: obtain some Hydrathistle.

## Tiger’s Eye
This private detective’s business is unremarkable on the outside, its only distinguishing mark an orange-and-black sign featuring a cat’s eyes. Inside is a regal apartment dimly lit by flickering oil lamps. The door is locked, and visitors must knock or ring the bell before being let in.

> You are looking for someone, yes? No. You want information.

They are met by Vincent Trench, a human detective and the owner of the Tiger’s Eye. He speaks concisely, dresses in a sharp suit, and smokes a slim pipe. Vincent is in fact a rakshasa named Valantajar that always casts disguise self on itself before seeing visitors. The rakshasa has lived in Waterdeep for years, switching identities as often as needed to keep its true nature hiden. It has grown accustomed to living among mortals and, much to its own astonishment, is rather fond of Waterdeep and its citizens.

### Services
Trench can discover any secret in Waterdeep, for a fee. Use your judgment when pricing its services; 50 gp is sufficient for most investigations, but if the characters want to learn secrets relating to the major antagonists of this adventure, the rakshasa might require a service in payment, such as slaying enemies that are hunting it, posting advertisements for its business in their tavern, or keeping tabs on someone Vincent has been hired to spy on.

## Book Wyrm’s Treasure
The front of this bookstore is adorned with a charming sign of a gold dragon curled around a treasure hoard of books and scrolls. Inside, the shop is decorated with beautiful hardwood, and the earthy scent of old books permeates the air. The library fills two floors of this three-story building, and it somehow seems to contain more shelves than the building should be able to hold.

The shop is managed by a short dragonborn of gold dragon ancestry named Rishaal the Page-Turner, who lives on the third floor. Rishaal, a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, is a mage, with these changes:

Rishaal is neutral.

### Services
The shop contains books of all sorts. In addition, Rishaal has a small collection of spellbooks and allows wizards to copy spells from them at the cost listed in the Spells for Sale table. He can scribe any of these spells as a spell scroll but charges twice the listed cost for this service.

## Zephyr Post
Birds of all colors can be seen delivering letters through the upper windows of this sky-blue townhouse at all hours of the day. The residents of Trollskull Alley and other nearby streets use the Zephyr Post to deliver letters to friends, colleagues, and mercenaries throughout Waterdeep. The inside of the shop is filled with the sweet aroma of Calishite incense.
 
The Zephyr Post’s hawks can deliver a message to any address in Waterdeep for 2 sp.

## Sewer Access
At the east end of Trollskull Alley is a removable metal grate that covers an opening. Below the grate, a ladder descends 20 feet into the Waterdeep sewer system.

## Rival

Emmek Frewn (NE)

> So Volo outbid me on this property, and now _you_ have it? Yeah you ding dongs sure look like business geniuses. (Chuckles: ding dongs hah). We're going to run in you into the ground lady.

Gives a "free" beer.

# Quests

Looking for money? Many factions in Waterdeep.

- Emerald Enclave: an interest in protecting nature or the natural order to join the Emerald Enclave. Druids and rangers are especially welcome.
- Harpers: Any smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of Waterdeep. Bards and wizards are especially welcome.
- Lord's Alliance: To become a member of the Lords’ Alliance faction in Waterdeep, a character must be a Waterdavian citizen. Those with criminal records can also join, provided they demonstrate their allegiance to the city.
- Xanathar Guild: Anyone can join the Xanathar Guild, which, despite its name, doesn’t have official guild status in Waterdeep. Before membership is granted, however, an applicant must pass a test that always involves the perpetration of a serious crime. Possibilities include murdering a guild member who has failed Xanathar in some fashion, kidnapping a Waterdavian citizen, collecting a ransom, robbing a hire-coach, or looting a warehouse.
- Zhentarim: The Black Network has an open recruitment policy. Anyone can join. Tenacity and loyalty are highly valued (but not essential) traits in new members. The Zhentarim is a shadow organization that trades mercenaries and goods (including weapons) for profit.

## Hydrathistle

There has been a shortage and the last time Fala tried to collect they were almost killed. Need you to escort them. 12 Stirges in a swamp outside town.

## Fence their paintings / bars

Start asking around for a fence - Zhentarim or Xanathar guild. Need to be a member.

## Buy some poison

Poison is expensive because it is highly illegal, although it is a relatively simple formula. Lesser Poison, Vial (25 GP). One use, DC 12 Constitution, for 1d4 damage. Can ask Fala how to make it for a cheaper source.

DC15 Investigation: find it. Otherwise, must join Xanathar or Zhents to obtain it.

## Quests to join Zhent

#### Handkerchief

> “I’d like you to steal a silk handkerchief from a Waterdavian noble and give it to a tiefling girl who lives in a crate at the corner of Net Street and Dock Street, by the wharf.”

Finding a noble isn’t hard, but snatching one’s handkerchief without being detected requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. One can also convince a noble to surrender it with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check. The tiefling girl in the crate thanks the characters for the hanky.

## Cat quest for Oleander / Mirage

Visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:

“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.
