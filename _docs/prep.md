## Secrets
- There is a great struggle in the underworld. Zhents appear to be at war with a large thieves guild.

## Scenes

### Rules
- No more group rolls. Need a role-playing reason for soing something.
- Metagaming. Can't discuss tactics, or act on unknown information.
- Characters have to act consistently.

### Transition
- Finethir never produced any gold, but allowed you to stay at his place for as long as you wanted.
- You destroyed a magic ring, restored a Wizard to his true self, and are looking for glory, so you visit the most well known tavern for hosting adventurers: the Yawning Portal in Waterdeep.
- Perhaps all of you are in it for glory? Are all of you willing to take on a thirst for fame and notoriety as a defining character trait?
- Need a reason for why all of you would be together in this tavern. (Need the story to make sense).

### Tavern brawl

> You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over.

> Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: “Ya pig! Like killin’ me mates, does ya?” Then a seven-foot-tall half-orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure — but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

Crowd is cheering / booing.

Get involved: roll initiative. to hit: 1d20 + prof. dmg: 1 + STR. Krentz at 3hp.
Hang back: Yagra beats Krentz unconscious, gets beaten herself. Durnan yells "out!" Gang carries out Krentz.

### [Troll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17040-troll)

> Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom — a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. It bares its yellow teeth and howls. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, “Troll!”

- Full health [Troll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17040-troll). Attacks whoever gets a big hit.
- [Durnan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149798-durnan) draws his greatsword, springs over the bar. Douses with lamp oil and sets it on fire when it falls.
- Yagra joins.
- Patrons will heal.
- Durnan tells you that you fought well. Reassures patrons, straightens up.

### Volo

> A dapper figure pushes against the tide of patrons - "Very well fought. You be adventurers, am I right. I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?

> He strokes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. “Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you’ve noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven’t seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur’s Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence.

> “My friend’s name is Floon Blagmaar. He’s got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped — or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?”

- Offer 10 gold to accept. DC 10 Insight - he ain't got the money. Awaiting payments for Volo's guide to monsters.
- Volo describes Floon as a handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was dressed in princely garb when Volo last saw him.
- Two nights ago, before Floon disappeared, he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward. Volo recommends that the characters start their search there.
- Embarrassed that he got Floon in trouble.
- Skewered Dragon is dubious and Zhentarim owned.
- Between Net st. and Fillet Lane (in dock ward).

### Talk with NPCs

[Description of familiar faces](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/introduction#FamiliarFaces)

### Blood in the streets

> As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. “Get on,” she says. “Nothing to see here.”

- Dozen guards
- 3 loyal Zhentarim
- Won't let characters near (but they can try to spy): "You working for the Zhentarim? Xanathar guild? What are you scum fighting about?" 

Dock ward isn't safe.

> Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings. You get to a street corner (I think Tiddles knows his way around the city already.) It overlooks the Skewered Dragon. One nearby shop stands out from the others. It has a deep purple facade, and in its window hangs a stuffed beholder. Above the door hangs a sign whose elaborate letters spell out “Old Xoblob Shop.”

Decide to go into the shop or continue.

#### Shop

> A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop’s door as you peer inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet. The hairless old gnome sitting cross-legged on the counter wears plum-colored robes. His cheeks are decorated with nine purple face-painted eyes.

>The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lavender smoke before raising a hand. “Hail and well met! Come browse the shelves of the most curious curiosity shop in the world!”

- Roll trinkets in Chap. 5, sells for 1d6 gold.
- DC 13 Intimidation or Persuasion:
- > He says that Floon and a well-dressed fellow of similar appearance and bearing (Renaer Neverember, though the gnome doesn’t know his name and didn’t recognize him) were jumped outside the shop by rough-looking men in black leather armor. Xoblob thinks there were five attackers, but none of them looked familiar. One of them had a black tattoo of a winged snake on his neck.
