## Scenes

### Tavern brawl

> You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over.

> Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: “Ya pig! Like killin’ me mates, does ya?” Then a seven-foot-tall half-orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure — but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

[Yagra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17035-thug) (Zhent) vs. 5 Xanathar guild [bandits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16798-bandit).

Crowd is cheering / booing.

Get involved: roll initiative. to hit: 1d20 + prof. dmg: 1 + STR. Krentz at 3hp.
Hang back: Yagra beats Krentz unconscious, gets beaten herself. Durnan yells "out!" Gang carries out Krentz.

### [Troll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17040-troll)

> Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom — a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. It bares its yellow teeth and howls. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, “Troll!”

- Full health [Troll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17040-troll). Attacks whoever gets a big hit.
- [Durnan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149798-durnan) draws his greatsword, springs over the bar. Douses with lamp oil and sets it on fire when it falls.
- Yagra joins.
- Patrons will heal.
- Durnan tells you that you fought well. Reassures patrons, straightens up.

### Volo

> A dapper figure pushes against the tide of patrons - "Very well fought. You be adventurers, am I right. I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?

> He strokes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. “Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you’ve noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven’t seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur’s Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence.

> “My friend’s name is Floon Blagmaar. He’s got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped — or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?”

- Offer 10 gold to accept. DC 10 Insight - he ain't got the money. Awaiting payments for Volo's guide to monsters.
- Volo describes Floon as a handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was dressed in princely garb when Volo last saw him.
- Two nights ago, before Floon disappeared, he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward. Volo recommends that the characters start their search there.
- Embarrassed that he got Floon in trouble.
- Skewered Dragon is dubious and Zhentarim owned.
- Between Net st. and Fillet Lane (in dock ward).

### Talk with NPCs

### Blood in the streets

> As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. “Get on,” she says. “Nothing to see here.”

- Dozen guards
- 3 loyal Zhentarim
- Won't let characters near (but they can try to spy): "You working for the Zhentarim? Xanathar guild? What are you scum fighting about?"
