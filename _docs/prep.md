## Scenes

### Tavern brawl

> You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over.

> Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: “Ya pig! Like killin’ me mates, does ya?” Then a seven-foot-tall half-orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure — but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

Yagra (Zhent) vs. 5 Xanathar guild.

Crowd is cheering / booing.

Get involved: roll initiative. to hit: 1d20 + prof. dmg: 1 + STR. Krentz at 3hp.
Hang back: Yagra beats Krentz unconscious, gets beaten herself. Durnan yells "out!" Gang carries out Krentz.

### Troll

> Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom — a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. It bares its yellow teeth and howls. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, “Troll!”

- Full health Troll. Attacks whoever gets a big hit.
