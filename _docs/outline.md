## Course Description

The principal objective of this course is to provide a basic introduction to econometric theory and its application. Much of the emphasis of the course is on the linear multiple regression model, under standard assumptions. The course begins with a review of probability and statistics, and ordinary least squares (OLS).

## Required Textbook

## Evaluation

| Assessment                   	| Weight 	|
|------------------------------	|--------	|
| Assignments                  	| 15%    	|
| Midterm Exam<br>(October 20) 	| 35%    	|
| Final Exam                   	| 50%    	|

### Assignments

You will use RStudio and work with data in order to complete your assignments. All assignments must be completed independently.

### Midterm and Final

These will be closed book exams. The midterm will take place in the regular class room/time. The final exam will be scheduled by the university. The final exam is *cumulative*.

## Grading

Each piece of assessment in the course will be graded on a percentage scale, according to a grading scheme. The percentage marks will then be weighted, as above, into a single numerical score that will be converted to a letter grade as follows:

|     F     |     D     |     C     |     C+    |     B     |     B+    |     A     |     A+     |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
|  0% - 50% | 50% - 57% | 57% - 64% | 64% - 72% | 72% - 80% | 80% - 87% | 87% - 93% | 93% - 100% |

Students appealing any term work (including, assignments, midterm, final exam) whether it be an informal or formal appeal must appeal their term work within 10 working days of receiving their mark. All final grades are subject to departmental approval.

A missed assessment will result in make-up work, or reweighting of your grade.

Nov. 22, 2022, is the last day for voluntary withdrawal from the course.

## Academic Integrity

*	All assignments and exams must be completed independently.
*	Do not engage in “contract” cheating.
*	Do not provide your UM Learn login information to anyone else. This is “personation”, a serious form of academic misconduct.

Ignorance is not a defense. Familiarize yourself with section 2.5 of Academic Misconduct Procedures.
