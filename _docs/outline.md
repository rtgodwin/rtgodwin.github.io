## Course Description

The principal objective of this course is to provide a basic introduction to econometric theory and its application. Much of the emphasis of the course is on the linear multiple regression model, under standard assumptions. The course begins with a review of probability and statistics, and ordinary least squares (OLS). We then begin to use the linear regression model as a basis for _causal inference_.

## Evaluation

| Assessment                   	| Weight 	|
|------------------------------	|--------	|
| Assignments                  	| 15%    	|
| Midterm Exam<br>(October 22)	| 35%    	|
| Final Exam                   	| 50%    	|

### Assignments

There will be 5 assignments, each worth 3% of your grade. You will use RStudio and work with data in order to complete your assignments. All assignments must be completed independently.

### Midterm and Final

These will be closed book exams. The midterm will take place in the regular class room/time. The final exam will be scheduled by the university. The final exam is *cumulative*.

## Grading

Each piece of assessment in the course will be graded on a percentage scale, according to a grading scheme. The percentage marks will then be weighted, as above, into a single numerical score that will be converted to a letter grade as follows:

|     F     |     D     |     C     |     C+    |     B     |     B+    |     A     |     A+     |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
|  0% - 50% | 50% - 57% | 57% - 64% | 64% - 72% | 72% - 80% | 80% - 87% | 87% - 93% | 93% - 100% |

Students appealing any term work (including, assignments, midterm, final exam) whether it be an informal or formal appeal must appeal their term work within 10 working days of receiving their mark. All final grades are subject to departmental approval.

A missed assessment will result in make-up work, or reweighting of your grade.

Nov. 19, 2024, is the last day for voluntary withdrawal from the course.

## Academic Integrity

*	All assignments and exams must be completed independently.
*	Do not engage in “contract” cheating.
*	Do not provide your UM Learn login information to anyone else. This is “personation”, a serious form of academic misconduct.

Ignorance is not a defense. Familiarize yourself with section 2.5 of Academic Misconduct Procedures.

## Statement of Academic Integrity / Misconduct from the U of M
Academic integrity is the commitment to upholding the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage in all scholarly activities (International Center for Academic Integrity (ICAI), 2013). Academic misconduct is any violation of the principles of academic integrity.

Students should acquaint themselves with the University’s Student Discipline Bylaw and related Procedures on academic misconduct (see Section 2.2.1) found in the Academic Calendar. Ignorance of the regulations and policies relating to academic misconduct is not a valid excuse for violating them.

The Faculty of Arts and The University of Manitoba regard acts of academic misconduct in course work and final exams as serious offences and may assess a variety of penalties depending on the nature of the infraction.

Acts of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to:

 - Plagiarism
 - Duplicate submission
 - Cheating on quizzes, tests, and exams , including possession of unauthorized materials such as cell phones, smart watches, PDAs, MP3 units, or electronic translators
 - Inappropriate Collaboration
 - Academic Fraud
 - Personation

## Generative AI (ChatGPT)

Students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence (ChatGPT) tools to contribute to their understanding of course materials. However, students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit to be assessed and assigned grades.

## Tentative Course Topics

*	Review of Probability
*	Review of Statistics
*	Linear Regression with One Regressor
*	Hypothesis Tests
*	Linear Regression with Multiple Regressors
*	Hypothesis Tests in Multiple Regression
*	Nonlinear Regression Functions
*	Heteroskedasticity
*	Instrumental Variables
*	Panel Data

## Student Accessibility Services
Students with disabilities should contact Student Accessibility Services to facilitate the implementation of accommodations, and meet with me to discuss the accommodations recommended by Student Accessibility Services.

**Regulations Regarding the Retention and Disposal of Term Work** Information regarding the breakdown of grades assigned to a student in a given course (i.e., grades assigned for term work, class participation, final examination, etc.) must be retained by the instructor and/or the respective department for three years following the end of term in which the course was taken. No student will be permitted to submit term work for assessment to the instructor (and term work should not be returned to students) by any means which allows unrestricted and unauthorized public access to the term work. For example, term papers, term tests or other written assignments should not be received or returned from a box outside the instructor’s office door, but a student could provide a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of the term work. Unreturned term work must be kept in a secure and confidential department area for a minimum of four (4) months following the end of the course and until destroyed by confidential measures. The Final day of the University’s Final Examination period each term is considered as the last day of the term. Instructors shall include on their course outlines a statement to the effect that unreturned term work will become the property of the Faculty of Arts and will be subject to confidential destruction.
