## Fall 2025 Midterm info:

The midterm will cover up to and including Chapter 5.1. Bring a non-programmable calculator, student ID, and writing implements. The exam takes place in the regular classroom at the regular time, on October 7th.

**Note: in previous years, we only had _one_ midterm. You have two. This means that the sample midterms contain additional material that has not yet been covered in this course.**
You should **ignore** the follow questions:
- 2023 Fall: 6, 7, 9, 11
- 2023 A02: 7, 8, 10, 11(c), 11(d), 12
- 2023 A01: 7, 8, 10, 11(c), 11(d), 12
- 2022: 7, 8, 10(d), 11
- 2021: All questions are appropriate, but are difficult (this was an open-book, online exam).
- 2020: 9, 10(d), 11
- Going back further than 2020 is risky.

You will see in the sample midterms that you will be provided with a formula sheet and table of standard normal probabilities.

Ignore the following practice questions from the end of each chapter:
- Ch.2: 3
- Ch.3: 3, 4, 5
- Ch.5: 3-7

## Final exam review topics

### Chapter 2
- Define / calculate (true) mean (from a prob. function)
- Same for variance
- Properties of mean / variance (if you multiply by $c$, variance is multiplied by $c^2$)
- Know what cov. and corr. are measuring (very similar - corr. is between -1 and 1)
- Skip blizzard/midterm example
- Basic result of CLT, and how it applies to sample average and LS estimator (it makes them Normal)

### Chapter 3
- Estimators (y-bar, LS intercept and slope) are random variables. Explain why
- Bias / efficiency / consistency (define these terms either in a sentence or an equation)
- Know that $\bar{y}$ and LS is unbiased / efficient / consistent under some assumptions.
- GM theorem - establishes efficiency
- Define: significance, type I and II error, critical value, confidence interval, p-value
- Basics of hypothesis testing
- Why t-test instead of z-test, and how the distribution changes from Normal to t when we use $s^2$
- $\hat{\sigma}^2$ (biased) and $s^2$ (unbiased)
- degrees of freedom

### Chapter 4
- Most models from econ are straight lines (linear)
- Begin to define the components of the pop. model
- The importance of the error term (epsilon)
- Predicted values and residuals
- Least squares is derived by min. sum of squared residuals
- LS is unbiased / efficient / consistent (don't bother with the 6 assumptions)

### Chapter 5
- R-square: define it. Pick it out in R output
- To derive: take sample variance of both sides of $y = \hat{y} + e$
- TSS / ESS / RSS terminology
- no fit / perfect fit (draw diagram)

- Hypothesis testing: calculate a t-stat, get the decision to reject/fail to reject correct.
- Reject H0 when: p-value is small (< 0.05) / t-stat is greater than crit. value (e.g. 1.96) / if hypothesis is outside the C.I.
- var(b1) tells us when the LS estimator becomes more efficient (3 things)

- Definition of dummy variables
- Interpretating the beta on a dummy variable

### Chapter 6
- Why we need multiple "X" variables - OVB
- OVB: what it is, when it happens, and why
  * house price/fireplace example
- How the formula for the $b$ are obtained
- Interpreting the $\beta$

Issues that arise in the multiple regression model:
- No perfect multicollinearity / DVT
  * define it
  * examples: different units/gender dummy/location dummy
- Imperfect multicollinearity - basic definition and consequences
- $R^2$ no longer works
  * explain why
- $\bar{R}^2$ used instead
  * explain why it works

### Chapter 7
- Joint hypothesis test
- t-test can't be used - explain why
- F-test
- Restricted/unrestricted models
- Why the F-test formula with $R^2_U$ and $R^2_R$ makes sense
- Identifying models under $H_0$ and $H_A$
- CIs don't extend well for joint hypothesis tests (confidence sets)
- Overall F-test
- How/why to eliminate variables from a model (model selection/building)
- Presenting models in tables

### Chapter 8
- Linear vs. non-linear effect
- Consequences of missing a non-linear effect
- Polynomial regressionn model
  * Determine "r"
  * Interpret the $b$ by predicting values ($\hat{y}$)
- Logs
  * Can "linearize" exponential growth (GDP)
  * Can "linearize" multiplicative models (Cobb-Douglas)
  * approximate percentage changes
  * 3 configurations: lin-log, log-lin, log-log
  * Intepretations of the $\beta$ in these three configurations
 
### Chapter 9
- Interaction terms
  * $D \times X$ allows for different slopes/lines for different groups
  * Test for differences between groups
- Dummy-dummy interactions
  * different effect for different groups
- DiD
  * minimum wage example
  * fundamental problem of causal inference
  * DiD estimator is the $b$ on the dummy-dummy interaction
  * Picture

### Chapter 10
- Hetroskedasticity vs. homoskedasticity
- What heterosked. and homosked. look like in a plot
- Implications of heteroskedasticity
- Fix for heterosked.
  * Robust standard errors
- Testing for het.

### Chapter 11
- Missing variable problem
- Instrument, $z$, has two properties
- IV/2SLS - describe the two stages
- wage/education example
- demand example
