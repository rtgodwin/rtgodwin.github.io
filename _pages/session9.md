## Links

## Recap
- The dead gnome killed in the fireball outside your door had the stone of Golorr.
- Stone was taken by an injured man limping away.
- Nimblewright launched the fireball. You have a nimblewright detector, and are standing outside the temple of Gond.

## Getting there
> Gralhunds a rich and power hungry family, Lady Gralhund especially. Not the cleanest reputation (orgies, possible links to Zhentarim).
 - Can follow the Nimblewright tracker to the estate.

## Infiltrating Gralhund Villa
 - 12 ft high walls. DC 15 Athletics without climbing gear / rope.
 - Anything loud calls city watch in 1d6 + 4.
 - May hear a scream from within the Villa to encourage them to enter.
 - Standing outside too long, neighbours notice (percepetion check).
 - **G1** Break (25 Athletics) pick (20)
 - Break in through **G3** stables. DC 20 Dex picklocks.
 - Breaking into the Villa to **G6**: DC 20 Athletics. Makes noise. Guard is called.

## G2
 PCs see the balcony. DC 15 Athletics to climb up without gear.
  - [Cult fanatic](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/cult-fanatic)
  - 2 [Death Dog](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/death-dog) with Seeming cast on them

## G8
> The floor is strewn with bodies. Two thugs holding bloody weapons stand over them. A third figure ascending the stairs, dressed in robes, turns to confront you.
  - [Evil Mage](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/evil-mage)
  - [Veteran Outlaw]([https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/veteran](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/veteran-outlaw)) Has a hostage.
  - 2 [Thug](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/thug)

## G12
> In one corner stands an iron lectern with a closed, locked, leather-bound tome resting on it.

DC 15 lockpick. 3 [specters](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/specter) appear.

## G13
> A battle rages between 6 Zhent thugs (20hp) and 4 guards ([Veterans](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/veteran) with 30hp). Lady Gralhund shouts "the  Watch are on their way!" The southern door is slightly ajar and you can hear someone curse and a boot hitting a door.
