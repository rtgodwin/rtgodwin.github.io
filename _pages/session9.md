## Recap
- The dead gnome killed in the fireball outside your door had the stone of Golorr.
- Stone was taken by an injured man limping away.
- Nimblewright launched the fireball. You have a nimblewright detector, and are standing outside the temple of Gond.

## Infiltrating Gralhund Villa
 - 12 ft high walls. DC 15 Athletics without climbing gear / rope.
 - Anything loud calls city watch in 1d6 + 4.
 - May hear a scream from within the Villa to encourage them to enter.
 - Standing outside too long, neighbours notice (percepetion check).
 - **G1** Break (25 Athletics) pick (20)
 - Break in through **G3** stables. DC 20 Dex picklocks.
 - Breaking into the Villa to **G6**: DC 20 Athletics. Makes noise. Guard is called.

## G2
 PCs see the balcony. DC 15 Athletics to climb up without gear.
  - [Cult fanatic](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/cult-fanatic)
  - 2 [Death Dog](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/death-dog) with Seeming cast on them
 

 - G8: At least 6 thugs. First thug takes a turn (DC 13 perception check) and calls out the squishiest member. Random on a fail.
