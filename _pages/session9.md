## Recap
- The dead gnome killed in the fireball outside your door had the stone of Golorr.
- Stone was taken by an injured man limping away.
- Nimblewright launched the fireball. You have a nimblewright detector, and are standing outside the temple of Gond.

## Secrets
 - “The Stone of Golorr is some kind of ancient creature transformed into an artifact. It knows the location of a hidden vault in Waterdeep containing half a million dragons.”
 - “House Gralhund has been bankrolling Black Network operations in Waterdeep, including the plot to kidnap Renaer Neverember and the plot to steal the Stone of Golorr from his father’s gnome spy, Dalakhar.”
 - “My wife was frustrated with the Zhents and their inability to secure the artifact. She gave a necklace of fireballs to her mechanical servant and sent it out to help retrieve the stone. It was careless and caught the Zhents in the fireball by mistake.”

## Getting there
> Gralhunds a rich and power hungry family, Lady Gralhund especially. Not the cleanest reputation (orgies, possible links to Zhentarim).

- Can follow the Nimblewright tracker to the estate.
- Encourage a choice between daylight and night.

 - Anything loud calls city watch in 1d6 + 4.
 - As soon as they get close to initiative, they hear a blood curdling scream coming from a feminine voice.
 - Standing outside too long, neighbours notice (percepetion check).
 - **G1** Break (25 Athletics) pick (20)

## G5 Kitchen

An unlocked wooden door leads from the yard to the mansion’s kitchen, which is stocked with cookware and utensils. A large fireplace is used for cooking meals.

## G6 Pantry

This pantry is lined with shelves containing dry foodstuffs, spices, folded tablecloths, and jars of preserves. Casks of fresh water, ale, and wine are also stored here.

**Barred Door**. A back door leads out to the street. This sturdy wooden door is barred shut on the inside. Forcing it open from the outside requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check and makes a lot of noise.

**Corpses**. The Zhents have killed two servants, an older male human (the head butler) and a younger male halfling (a cook), and left their bodies on the floor.

## G7 Laundry Room

This room is where servants wash clothing. It contains scrub buckets, wash basins, soap, mops, and chamber pots.

**Corpses**. The Zhents have killed a servant, a middle-aged female human (the head maid), and left her body on the stairs leading up to the servants’ quarters (area G19). The maid has a ring of keys on her belt that opens all the locked doors in the mansion as well as the cabinets in area G8.

## G8
> The floor is strewn with bodies. Two thugs holding bloody weapons stand over them. A third figure ascending the stairs, dressed in robes, turns to confront you.

# Session 10

## Recap

- The stone reveals the treasure. A gnome was coming to your bar with the stone. He got fireballed outside your door. The nimblewright that threw the fireball came here. The burned man who retrieved the stone is upstairs trying to kick down a door, a noble is cowering inside. They are Zhents killing guards and servants.
