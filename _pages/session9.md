## Recap
- The dead gnome killed in the fireball outside your door had the stone of Golorr.
- Stone was taken by an injured man limping away.
- Nimblewright launched the fireball. You have a nimblewright detector, and are standing outside the temple of Gond.

## Secrets
 - “The Stone of Golorr is some kind of ancient creature transformed into an artifact. It knows the location of a hidden vault in Waterdeep containing half a million dragons.”
 - “House Gralhund has been bankrolling Black Network operations in Waterdeep, including the plot to kidnap Renaer Neverember and the plot to steal the Stone of Golorr from his father’s gnome spy, Dalakhar.”
 - “My wife was frustrated with the Zhents and their inability to secure the artifact. She gave a necklace of fireballs to her mechanical servant and sent it out to help retrieve the stone. It was careless and caught the Zhents in the fireball by mistake.”

## Getting there
> Gralhunds a rich and power hungry family, Lady Gralhund especially. Not the cleanest reputation (orgies, possible links to Zhentarim).
 - Can follow the Nimblewright tracker to the estate.

## Infiltrating Gralhund Villa
 - 12 ft high walls. DC 15 Athletics without climbing gear / rope.
 - Anything loud calls city watch in 1d6 + 4.
 - May hear a scream from within the Villa to encourage them to enter.
 - Standing outside too long, neighbours notice (percepetion check).
 - **G1** Break (25 Athletics) pick (20)
 - Break in through **G3** stables. DC 20 Dex picklocks.
 - Breaking into the Villa to **G6**: DC 20 Athletics. Makes noise. Guard is called.

## G2

 - 2 [Death Dog](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/death-dog) with Seeming cast on them

## G8
> The floor is strewn with bodies. Two thugs holding bloody weapons stand over them. A third figure ascending the stairs, dressed in robes, turns to confront you.
 - [Evil Mage](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/evil-mage)
 - [Veteran Outlaw]([https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/veteran](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/veteran-outlaw)) Has a hostage.

## G12
> In one corner stands an iron lectern with a closed, locked, leather-bound tome resting on it.

DC 15 lockpick. 3 [specters](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/specter) appear.

## G13
> A battle rages between 6 Zhent thugs (20hp) and 4 guards ([Veterans](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/veteran) with 30hp). Lady Gralhund shouts "the  Watch are on their way!" The southern door is slightly ajar and you can hear someone curse and a boot hitting a door.

## G15
> You see a wounded man wearing burnt clothes trying to kick down a door.
