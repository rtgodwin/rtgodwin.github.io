## You have taken the Sea Ghost

<span class="spoiler">[Schematic of the entire ship.](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/matelo-kaloje-dm-tzaritsa/a/sea-ghost-vehicle-1)</span>

Ship modifier: -10 (+ 2 each expert role) + crew/5

10 crew minimum, 20 is a full complement. Specific roles that are needed to maintain crew quality:

  - **Captain**. The captain issues orders. The best captains have high Intelligence and Charisma scores, as well as proficiency with water vehicles and the Intimidation and Persuasion skills.

  - **First Mate**. This specialist keeps the crew’s morale high by providing supervision, encouragement, and discipline. A first mate benefits from a high Charisma score, as well as proficiency with the Intimidation and Persuasion skills.

  - **Bosun**. The bosun (or boatswain) provides technical advice to the captain and crew and leads repair and maintenance efforts. A good bosun has a high Strength score, as well as proficiency with carpenter’s tools and the Athletics skill.

  - **Quartermaster**. The quartermaster plots the ship’s course, relying on knowledge of nautical charts and a study of weather and sea conditions. A reliable quartermaster tends to have a high Wisdom score, as well as proficiency with navigator’s tools and the Nature skill.

  - **Surgeon**. The ship’s surgeon tends to injuries, keeps illnesses from spreading throughout the ship, and oversees sanitation. A capable surgeon benefits from a high Intelligence score, as well as proficiency with herbalism kits and the Medicine skill.

  - **Cook**. A ship’s cook works with the limited ingredients aboard a ship to make meals. A skilled cook keeps the crew’s morale in top shape, while a poor one drags down the entire crew’s performance. A talented cook has a high Constitution score, as well as proficiency with brewer’s supplies and cook’s utensils.

### Smuggler's ship

You all got a 100 gp advance on the 500 gp reward for accepting the quest to take care of the smuggling ship.

The town council believes a smuggling ship is likely to return soon, possibly around the next new moon, and suspects it is transporting large quantities of weapons. They’ve ordered nightly patrols at likely rendezvous points but do not want to endanger volunteers by forcing a confrontation. Instead, they task the you with boarding the ship when it appears, discovering who is receiving the weapons, assessing any threat, and eliminating any pirate danger. To aid in this mission, the council provides a fishing boat, nonmagical equipment as needed, and two guards to assist with sailing.

Spend 10 minutes coming up with a plan, and then off you go!
