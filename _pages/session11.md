# Session 11

### Possible relevant rules
  - 100 days of 8 hour days to train new tool proficiency (plus/minus).

### Recap

- Dead Wizard
- Everyone else crammed on the jolly boat and escaped
- 2 bandits still tied up
- You have not yet found any weapons, or evidence of who or where weapons are being smuggled to.

### Search the boat, gather the evidence.

Each player pick a room, players that haven't gone yet can pop in.

  - 8: Wizard's boot contains a key. Locked chest. 50 gp and gust of wind.
  - 9: The captain's desk contains love letters. This guy fucks. He's known under several different names and is definitely scamming a woman in every port. Amongst the loveletters is a page that is out of place. The Lizardfolk contract. Chest contains half the Lizardfolk's payment.
  - 11: A lot of goods stolen from the crown.
  - 12: Bosun's cabin. Locked chest with 200 sp. A parrot repeats "pieces of eight!". Dimensions look weird.
  - 13: First mate's cabin. Unlocked sea chest with 500 sp.
  - 16: Star Wars garbage compactor vibe. 2 swarms of rot grubs in bilge.
  - After an hour, the jolly boat returns.

### Decide on the fate of the boat, and the smuggled goods
  - There are a dozen or so town guard around the haunted mansion.
  - Large quantity of contraband, fencing the last bit was very difficult. You will not be able to sell these goods in Saltmarsh. The bandits were smuggling them out. These bear the mark of the crown. Representatives of the crown will pay something.

  - Royal agents will likely want to claim the ship. It is worth around 10000 gp. You can:
    - Steal the ship and sell the contraband, life of piracy
    - Submit the smuggled goods, and try to convince the town council to give it to you in return for your continued service

### Sail back to Saltmarsh
  - Roll for Hazard
  - Try to dock. DC 10. Take the skiff.

### Report to the town council
  - Gellan Primewater (Fredward): Traditionalist. A dapper older gentleman with a neat beard and a fancy wardrobe. Richest man in town. Frequently hosts parties. Smuggler ties.
  - Anders Solmor (Jimothy): Neutral. Recently inherited his family's fishing fleet after the untimely death of his mother. His butler whispers something in his ear.
  - Eliander Fireborn (Deeper Kwasi): "Well shiver me timber," he taps his wooden leg on the floor. Captain of the Town Guard, a burly man with a finely carved wooden peg leg. "Well? What is your report?"
  - Did they "neutralize" the smuggling operation.
  - So far Lizardfolk have not been a bother. Are they stockpiling weapons and planning an attack? Give us a moment.
  - A steward ushers you to the back of the town hall. The council huddles and begin to whisper. (roll)
  - The Loyalists (Eliander and Manistrad) think the town needs the King to bring in more troops and a few ships like in Seaton. The traditionalists (Gellan and Eda) do not want to become the next Seaton, and insist the town can take care of this on their own. Anders looks to you to break the tie.
  - Give them ship in return for investigating the lizardfolk lair. Gather a crew and do this before Eliander sends to the king for a party. 20 days.

### Downtime
  - You each have 20 days to spend before you must set off or Eliander will send for an adventuring party.
  - 1d20 gp for Stickum
  - Item table.

### Finding crew
  - You will encounter hazards and situations where your ship makes a d20 check. Fully staffed ship has +4 (max +10). -10 (+ 2 each expert role) + crew/5.
  - Crew looking for work found at the taverns and docks.
  - Hire a crew (2sp/day per person, 4sp for you). Danger.
  - Skilled crew (2gp per day).
 
#### Bosun

Tamsin Reedwhistle: Use Commoner or Bandit stat block with 14 Strength and carpenter’s tools proficiency.

  - You notice someone discreetly admiring your ship.
  - "Something about her. Looks like she needs a few adjustments. If you just moved that line over there..."
  - "Ain't no way I'm joining your crew. You guys are nuts! Unless... are you actually good in a fight? I mean I've heard the stories, but, look at you. No offense!"
  - "Do you know what can fix any medium hole in a pinch? Tendrils from a shambling mound! Get some and you'll prove your worth in combat."
  - Scorched (half hit points)

#### Quartermaster

Nalia Greyfin: Expert navigator; Commoner stats with high Wisdom, proficiency in Navigator’s Tools and Nature.

  - We lost our quartermaster. She's here in town on some fool quest. She found a map and won't let it go until she follows it to the end.
  - (DC 15 Arcana) Map is cursed. She cannot move far away from the location on the map.
  - Holed up in the Wicker Goat. Will pay everything she has (4 gold 23 silver) for escort.
  - In the Hool Marshes, are the ancient ruins of a temple. 2 Specter.

#### Healer

Elias Tamberlain: Commoner stats with 16 INT, Medicine proficiency, herbalism kit proficiency.

  - At Temple of Procan, there are a few initiates working off their training debt.
  - Elias would love to join a ship, but I still have several months healing here that I owe to Wellgar.
  - Wellgar: it's not about gold, it's about service to Procan. If you can repay Elias's service, I will consider the debt settled.
  - Procan has revealed to me a small shipwreck half a days sail from here. Recover the remains of any sailors that you can, so I can lay them to rest.
  - 2 ghouls
  - 3 coins on the ship that are glowing purple and clearly cursed. If the coin is touched Wisdom save or head toward center of island.

#### Cook

Ghor Marshbloom: Commoner with 14 Constitution and proficiency in cook’s utensils & brewer’s supplies.

  - None of the cooks or apprentices are willing to work on a ship where there's any element of danger. 
  - You learn there's a crab chowder competition in Crabber's Cove in 3 days.
  - There are 9 booths. 25 cp each. One of them is quite delicious, but tastes a bit strange. He's got a shitload of jarred and magically preserved chowder for sale. It's expensive stuff.
  - Ghoran looks to the sea a bit nervously.
  - 1 giant scorpion emerges looking for revenge. They go right for Ghoran. "My life's work!" The magic to preserve the chowder cost him everything, but they make nearby giant crabs go into a frenzy.
  - "How can I ever repay you?"

### Receive next quest
  - Sail to Lizardfolk.
