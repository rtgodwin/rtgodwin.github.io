# Recap

- You made 45 gold gladiating some rats
- You left the town of Garmsby, promised not to tell on their rat fight club, and carried on to the next
- You all have your own reasons for adventuring, but they all coincide with a trip to the city of Cardwatch. The roads are dangerous, you opted to travel together.
- 2 of you know each other from before.

## Nyx

- The Gnomes of the small village of Gladmilion enjoy a rich and lavish lifestyle due to their trade of the Gladmilion Poppy, the cultivation of which unfortunately renders all male gnomes utterly impotent.
- The profitability of the Gladmilion Poppy afforded the residents a permanent solution: a Gnomelight Vigorvine. In a prank gone awry, Nyx destroyed the Vigorvine, and must raise the funds for, and return with, a replacement.
- She has latched onto the druid Leafy, and has been asking some weird questions about plants. She thinks she can get it from the grove that Leafy is travelling to.

## Mick

- You're a simple guy who knows what he likes, and what he likes is his pet slime. This is an awakened Gray Ooze that has a telepathic link with Mick.
- No one knows Mick is carrying a bucket of disgusting, potentially dangerous, slime in his pack.
- The Ooze is sick. Mick needs to administer a healing potion every tenday, and feed it a non-magical metal weapon.
- Mick you don't actually know what is wrong with your ooze and that is part of your quest.
- The guy really likes his darts. To a fault. Like, instead of pulling out his sword in a fight, he pulled out some darts first. You know this is going to be a problem.

Secret: the Ooze has Arcane Flux from consuming a magical item.

##  Brynwyn

- So she's a miserable racist, isn't it what's in her heart that counts? Plus, she says she really likes your peoples food.
- Classic dragon slaying quest. Is essentially a mercenary until she is powerful enough to kill the dragon that wronged her ancestors years ago.

## Leafy

- Needs to travel to a distant grove to prove their worldliness.

## Srimar

- A discredited academic.

# Travel to Gladnum

> After 3 days journey of camping in the wilds you are again ready to try your luck at an inn.
> Two guards greet you at the town gates. (Red potatoes) What is your business in Gladnum?
> You make your way to the Gilded Goose.

### Tavern: The Studded Goose
Owner: Ristan Stanran, Male Human
Location: In a side street near the town gate. The street outside has a weird smell.

- Has a hearth. 30 or so patrons. Dartboard and a cardtable. Loud cheering a drunkeness, pretty rowdy. 
> Eyes you up and sees your weapons. Please. Just no fighting. A round on the house. Just stay out of trouble. Please, I beg you.

Roll a d100, and a d6(reroll 6) and d4 to determine participants.
