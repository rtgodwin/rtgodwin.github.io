# Recap

- You made 45 gold gladiating some rats
- You left the town of Garmsby, promised not to tell on their rat fight club, and carried on to the next
- You all have your own reasons for adventuring, but they all coincide with a trip to the city of Cardwatch. The roads are dangerous, you opted to travel together.
- 2 of you know each other from before.

## Nyx

- The Gnomes of the small village of Gladmilion enjoy a rich and lavish lifestyle due to their trade of the Gladmilion Poppy, the cultivation of which unfortunately renders all male gnomes utterly impotent.
- The profitability of the Gladmilion Poppy afforded the residents a permanent solution: a Gnomelight Vigorvine. In a prank gone awry, Nyx destroyed the Vigorvine, and must raise the funds for, and return with, a replacement.
- She has latched onto the druid Leafy, and has been asking some weird questions about plants. She thinks she can get it from the grove that Leafy is travelling to.

## Mick

- You're a simple guy who knows what he likes, and what he likes is his pet slime. This is an awakened Gray Ooze that has a telepathic link with Mick.
- No one knows Mick is carrying a bucket of disgusting, potentially dangerous, slime in his pack.
- The Ooze is sick. Mick needs to administer a healing potion every tenday, and feed it a non-magical metal weapon.
- Mick you don't actually know what is wrong with your ooze and that is part of your quest.
- The guy really likes his darts. To a fault. Like, instead of pulling out his sword in a fight, he pulled out some darts first. You know this is going to be a problem.

Secret: the Ooze has Arcane Flux from consuming a magical item.

##  Brynwyn

- So she's a miserable racist, isn't it what's in her heart that counts? Plus, she says she really likes your peoples food.
- Classic dragon slaying quest. Is essentially a mercenary until she is powerful enough to kill the dragon that wronged her ancestors years ago.

## Leafy

- Needs to travel to a distant grove to prove their worldliness.

## Srimar

- A discredited academic.

# Travel to Gladnum

> After 3 days journey of camping in the wilds you are again ready to try your luck at an inn.
> Two guards greet you at the town gates. (Red potatoes) What is your business in Gladnum?
> You make your way to the Gilded Goose. You eye a job board with a couple adds on the way in.

### Tavern: The Studded Goose
Owner: Ristan Stanran, Male Human
Location: In a side street near the town gate. The street outside has a weird smell.

- Has a hearth. 30 or so patrons. Dartboard and a cardtable. Loud cheering a drunkeness, pretty rowdy. 
> Eyes you up and sees your weapons. Please. Just no fighting. A round on the house. Just stay out of trouble. Please, I beg you.
> The party hears a group of 4 half-orcs yelling insults at an adjacent table of 2 half-elfs.

Roll a d100, and a d6(reroll 6) and d4 to determine participants.
[Random conversations](https://www.dndspeak.com/2021/05/13/100-prompts-for-idle-chit-chat-between-characters/)
> Old man looking for grammy's apple pie.
> Greencloaks got Bess! A few people shake their heads and cry out. Most shrug sadly.

- Greencloaks are cultists that have setup camp that have been trying to kidnap townspeople for their ritual. They have so far been unsuccessful. They have only been targetting Dwarves.

> Insults escalate.

### Darts
- Make a ranged attack with your dart to see what ring you hit.
- Roll again DC10 x2, DC15 x3, DC20 50pt or trip 20.
- Win your bet.
- A guy with some fancy darts steps up.

> One half-orc draws his sword: ``say that again''. Attacks. What do you do?

- Someone needs to inevitably die.
- The tavern freezes in anticipation.
- Innkeeper: no no no
- Within moments Jarzon appears.
 
> A pale, bald, hooded figure in a crimson cloak, and with glowing red eyes appears as if out of nowhere. He is accompanied by a giant half-orc clad in platemail and a skull helmet, with a giant great axe at his side. ``You have once again upheld your side of the terms. Yesss. Business is good. Cackles.'' Hands him 1 red gold for each corpse. The innkeeper shudders. Drogear, prepare the corpses. (Casts mass teleport).

- Innkeeper tries to give the blood money to the PCs.
- Which job do you choose?
