# Recap

- You made 45 gold gladiating some rats
- You left the town of Garmsby, promised not to tell on their rat fight club, and carried on to the next
- You all have your own reasons for adventuring, but they all coincide with a trip to the city of Cardwatch. The roads are dangerous, you opted to travel together.
- 2 of you know each other from before.

## Nyx

- The Gnomes of the small village of Gladmilion Prairie enjoy a rich and lavish lifestyle due to their trade of the Gladmilion Poppy, the cultivation of which unfortunately renders all male gnomes utterly impotent.
- The profitability of the Gladmilion Poppy afforded the residents a permanent solution: a Gnomelight Vigorvine. In a prank gone awry, Nyx destroyed the Vigorvine, and must raise the funds for, and return with, a replacement.
- She has latched onto the druid Leafy, and has been asking some weird questions about plants. She thinks she can get it from the grove that Leafy is travelling to.
