**[Quantitative Methods in Economics](https://rtgodwin.com/quantecon.pdf)** is currently in use for all sections of ECON 2040 at the University of Manitoba. It is an introductory text covering the basics of statistics and probability for an economics program. R is used on real and simulated data sets, all which can be easily accessed. The book ends with least squares, and a brief introduction to multiple regression.

[Introduction to Econometrics](https://rtgodwin.com/itroeconometrics.pdf) is the textbook that I use for teaching ECON 3040. It begins with a brief review of statistics and probability, and then gets into topics such as multiple regression and omitted variable bias, dummy variables, non-linearities, and instrumental variables.

[Econometrics I](https://rtgodwin.com/econometrics1.pdf) are the lecture notes I use for teaching the graduate level ECON 7010 - Introduction to Econometrics.
