## Session 0

- Describe your character in 1-2 sentences. A trait and a flaw. Motivation for adventuring (money / secret / thirst / personal quest) or do you want me to make something up for you. Develop as we go.
- We need to figure out how you know each other or at least why you're travelling together. 

> It's a *** nowhere town, after a long days journey on your way to *cough*, you stumble into the inn The Lonely Woodsman exhausted and hungry. You would normally just camp, but their flyers said they were cheap, and you're broke (each roll 4d4 sp).
  
- Plan for game: series of one-shots for now
- Combat / exploration and puzzles / roleplay?
- What sort of setting? Pirates / icewind dale icy dungeon and save a town from a curse / go to Candlekeep and help some wizards / don't care
- Any off limits topics?
- You have to roleplay - don't have to talk but at least have to narrate what your character is saying or doing
- Metagaming - you gotta do what your character would do, each player's turn is not a team effort, you have to stfu as much as possible when not your turn, no one can help you
- The person who calls it makes the check - maybe you can roleplay why a 2nd or 3rd check could be made, or figure out how to help
- In combat try to prep your turn

## Garmsby

- Locals eye them with excitement / anticipation.
- Innkeeper Gomory Bulmage whines loudly about a rat problem.
- Server (Jumcups) is covered in rat bites. Flinches.
- You hear a squeek and a sharp cry and a patron yelling "godsdamned rats!"
- 1 sp to stay, 6cp for a meal

### Secrets

- Perception: something's up, people are too excited
- Insight: People are hiding something
- There are indeed rats around

## Gomery Bulmage

> If only some adventurers would take care of our rat problem in the cellar!
> Any adventurers looking for a reward for clearing out some rats?
> I do hate to ask this, but you look like the adventuring type. Would you be interested in a free meal and nights stay in return for clearing out some rats in the cellar? (Will throw in an extra 5 sp per person)

## Stairs down

> The innkeeper opens the door to the cellar and beckons you forth. The patrons seem to watch in trepidation as you begin to descend the stairs.

- Marching order?
- As soon as the last PC descends door slams and a giant wooden plank pushes them down the stairs. DC 12 Dex save - 1d4 falling damage.

> (Interrupt me if you like). It is dark, can you see? You have tumbled down the stairs into a small arena in the basement of the inn. A cage surrounds you and the door up the stairs appears sealed shut. You hear people conversing, laughing. Torches begin to light around you. Patrons descend into the arena seats. You can hear them starting to take bets.

- There are two grates that look like they can open up to let things into the arena.
- Odds 3-2 in PCs favor.
- Will let them go and pay them if they win.
- "You'll do fine, just don't panic! And try to separate them! (Gets reprimanded for influencing the fight)"
- After a few minutes the grates open. Roll intiative!
- 5 giant rats emerge

> Don't be shitheads, you did great. we give our gladiators 10%. Tonight that works out to (10d10).
