## Garmsby

> It's a *** nowhere town, after a long days journey on your way to *cough*, you stumble into inn The Lonely Woodsman exhausted and hungry. You hope that they are cheap, cause you are broke (each roll 4d4 sp).

- Locals eye them with excitement / anticipation.
- Innkeeper Gomory Bulmage whines loudly about a rat problem.
- Server (Jumcups) is covered in rat bites. Flinches.
- You hear a squeek and a sharp cry and a patron yelling "godsdamned rats!"
- 1 sp to stay, 6cp for a meal

## Gomery Bulmage

> If only some adventurers would take care of our rat problem in the cellar!
> Any adventurers looking for a reward for clearing out some rats?
> I do hate to ask this, but you look like the adventuring type. Would you be interested in a free meal and nights stay in return for clearing out some rats in the cellar? (Will throw in an extra 5 sp per person)


## Stairs down

> The innkeeper opens the door to the cellar and beckons you forth. The patrons seem to watch in trepidation as you begin to descend the stairs.

- Marching order?
- As soon as the last PC descends door slams and a giant wooden plank pushes them down the stairs. DC 12 Dex save - 1d4 falling damage.

> (Interrupt me if you like). It is dark, can you see? You have tumbled down the stairs into a small arena in the basement of the inn. A cage surrounds you and the door up the stairs appears sealed shut. You hear people murmuring, laughing. Torches begin to light around you. Patrons descend into the arena seats.
